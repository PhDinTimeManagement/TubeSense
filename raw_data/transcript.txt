--------------------------------

sandon the largest cave on our planet this cave is so massive that it has a completely self-sustaining ecosystem with its own climate conditions hundreds of meters underground the clouds you're used to seeing in the sky form inside this cave son even has an untouched prehistoric rainforest hidden far below the surface and a vast underground river from transparent fish to colorful monkeys over 250 endic plant and animal species live in this underground world seven new animal species were recently discovered here and are unique to this place stretching 9 km in length this cave holds 38.5 million cub m of space and its passages are so enormous that a 40story skyscraper could fit inside and its giant stellagmites are rising like towers of ancient cities walking inside it's impossible not to feel as small as a tiny bug can a rock move on its own sandon even contains phytocarst rocks which move towards the sun like semi-living organisms rare cave pearls and many other unique formations are also found here for 3 million years since its formation the world had no idea about this cave's existence until it was fully explored in 2009 in Vietnam now it's time for you to see the largest cave on Earth individual access is forbidden to protect both visitors and the fragile environment this expedition is operated by Oxalus the only authorized agency to reach Song Dong we've tked through the jungle for 9 hours and now we must pass through N Cave the world's third largest cave this cave serves as a gateway to the world's largest cave it's crucial to be fully prepared for every possibility so before setting out on this journey we did deep online research about Song Dong and its surrounding area to learn about everything that we would need to know now we're heading towards the beach inside the cave over the centuries water from nearby rivers gradually carved this place the ceiling is 145 m high and the cave is 200 m wide during the flooding season much of this empty space is submerged underwater you can understand from the basket over there the water levels rise so much that it can carry objects up to that level with a breathtaking lake in front of us it was impossible not to take a quick dip at dusk the sound of swift birds echoes in the cave because of their short and weak legs these birds can't take off from the ground and must jump from a high place to fly if they are trapped on the ground it means death is certain for these birds this one was unlucky and waited to die at sunrise we're ready for the journey to Song Dong if we call this cave a neighborhood then SDong is a massive city in comparison we will move to the darkness now I can't help but wonder what awaits us in Sonong as we walk dozens of crickets on the ground start jumping from side to side the ground is covered with centuries of bat guano above us countless bats hang in deep sleep but some are awake and constantly defecating on us so it's not a good idea to look up that's how my arm looks we pass by formations that look like travertine the limestone steps take us to the path that leads to Saong wow the view here is amazing you can see some water coming down from both sides encave welcomed us for a night deep in the jungle now it's time to meet Song Cave it's trying to come to me you know it's moving towards me it knows what to leech on it got too big beneath the soil we walk on lies the 450 millionyear-old limestone formation which began forming long before the existence of humans or even dinosaurs this calcium richch limestone is composed of shells and skeletons of ancient sea animals that sank to the ocean floor and gradually compressed over millions of years however since calcium dissolves easily in acid acid rain slowly erodess limestone and forms caves over time this is how the world's largest cave was formed by rain dissolving limestone a challenging final climb brings us down to the grand entrance of Sondong as we move deeper everyone's switching on their headlamps now this path will lead us to the Hope and Vision Passage in this 9 km long cave there is so much to explore we might be the first to record newly discovered animals this is the entrance of Sondong Cave you can see those people look tiny at the entrance even just a few steps in we're surrounded by incredible cave formations the water rich in minerals flows down from the ceilings or walls and builds these beautiful rimstone pools over time the very first animal greeting us is a cricket we are making our way through the rocks some stagmites are sparkling in pure white because of the mineral type they're composed of it looks like a diamond yes it does there's a huge stactite in bronze color resembling frozen waterfalls the orange brown hues suggests the presence of iron or other minerals mixed within the limestone some stactites have actually broken off from the ceiling and fell down to the ground that one in the middle is a fault line it was formed because of tectonic movements of the earth song's enormous size is not just the result of water erosion but also the fractures caused by tectonic movements which created pathways for water to flow deeper there is a huge river in this part of the cave if you fall you can't swim it's so fast heavy rains feed many rivers here and a large and fast river now flows through the cave how did this come to life we are like hundreds of meters inside the cave there is no sunlight heavy floods can bring soil and plant stems into the cave that's why we see a sprouted seed here unfortunately without sunlight they won't survive for long the flood also brought spores in so now there are mushrooms growing here the moisture and darkness are perfect for them just yesterday the water reached up to here it carried a lot of mud with it it's so recent as if the fault just happened here signs of the incident are still visible we reached the hope and vision passage this is the largest part of the cave i'm standing next to the tallest stagmite in the world it is 80 m high it took an average of 800,000 years for these minerals to accumulate on the ground as water dripped from the ceiling and formed this massive stelagmite the reason it got so huge is because it grew in a part of the cave where the ceiling is over 170 m high and more than 130 m wide so this part of the cave is as large as a 40story skyscraper could fit and even a double-decker aircraft could fly through you can see the light coming from the first doin very far ahead that's where we are heading we spot cloudylike white catches on the ground what is this a spiderweb when they sense vibrations of a trapped insect the spider jumps out bites the prey and returns to the funnel to eat these are sand towers when water drips from above the parts under the pebbles are protected while their surroundings erode and in the end it forms these towers it looks like a small metropolis if you carefully look at it there's a guy standing on the top of that rock our teammate in the far distance is now standing on a slide might of 60 m in length we move 3 km forward in the cave this is our camping site imagine sleeping here looking at this view from here you can partially see the first due line it might look like the cave's exit but it's actually the first of two massive due lines and from here on things will get more incredible the temperature difference between the outside and the inside of the cave forms mist and clouds inside the cave the area beyond them is called watch out for dinosaurs we will explore that place tomorrow for now it's time to rest now we are going to first do this is the next day there will be a lot of things that we will see today let's go we are crawling through narrow passages to get to the first dine a very narrow point these sticky threads are traps belonging to cave worms they produce a blue green light from their tail to attract flying insects to these sticky threads once an insect gets stuck the larvae pulls up the thread with its mouth and eats its prey this limestone is the oldest limestone in Southeast Asia it is more than 400 million years old while some sea creatures become part of the limestone others mineralized and ended up as fossils like you see in this example we'll get into the details of this fossil later we're almost there son well it takes for water droplets to reach the ground for like 20 seconds from up there what is the height of this wall it's around 140 m everything is huge here when you look up you can see the trees of the rainforest surrounding the opening but right now we are meters below and still inside the cave the reason why this hole exists is that hundreds of thousands of years ago the river flowing inside Song Dong eroded the limestone and weakened the roof the roof couldn't hold up and collapsed creating this giant hole above so the light gave life to these algaes and mosses in the afternoon we'll go to Delane number two it's very different you'll see a real jungle there but first let's see the first of the last two incredible formations here this is also a stellag might but it's a different one it owes its unique layered shape to the waterfalls these are phytocarst formations they're rare limestone formations shaped by the growth of algae mosses and microorganisms together with calcium carbonate since both biological and geological processes shape them they're like partly a living and partly non-living here you can see the phytocarse formations moving toward the sun like a hand extending from the cave climbing 1 km down and up in the dark we finally reached our next destination this is the second dolan much bigger than the first one this looks amazing all of a sudden we are in a forest in a cave look here they're so dense the roof of the cave at this point collapsed as a result of the intersection of two main faults forming a due line on the surface 252 m above where we are the collapsed cave roof allowed sunlight to enter giving rise to an entirely new ecosystem despite extreme conditions plants and animals have managed to adapt and turn this place into a unique underground rainforest as we move forward towards the light the height of the plants grow the soil makes it perfect to form a rainforest a large portion of the soil here consists of bat guano it is accumulated for millions of years and is highly fertile the soil here is deep and full of small holes there is an insect in each hole and the insects are making traps in these falls to catch animals this jungle is huge the biologists have found more than 200 species of plants and almost 60 species of animals living in this area there are some monkeys on trees this might be the only cave where monkeys live most primates typically prefer trees as their habitat and cave environments are not suitable for them however this extraordinary cave has become a new living space for certain species we came across a centipede and snakes are living in this forest as well sound of this forest is calming even the explorers who first came here in 2009 thought they'd found the exit for a moment remember that we are in a cave this cave has its own rainforest all of these trees get thinner but taller to reach the sunlight coming from above that's why all of them are very thin but very tall compared to their width certain trees reach heights of 40 to 50 m it's because the trees prioritize height to maximize sunlight absorption this is the remains of a snail monkeys catch these snails and break them with stones then eat them as we move through the cave we start coming across signs redshin dukes have left behind look so many snails most of them are broken and probably eaten by a monkey we kind of forget we're in the cave because it's so massive this is where we are going to camp tonight it's our fourth and final day in the cave today we navigate through a waterfield passage before reaching the Great Wall of Vietnam the stagmites here look fascinating almost like the work of a sculptor a pool of water surrounds this column and fish are swimming in it these fish have no eyes as they have adapted to live in this total darkness instead their other senses got stronger over time see how it doesn't give any reaction to the shadow of my hand or the movement it doesn't see anything like the fish this cricket is completely blind it doesn't see me these super rare formations are called cave pearls they are usually 1 cm in diameter but here since they are too old some of them are as big as a tennis ball just like real pearls they form around a tiny nucleus such as a grain of sand with layers of minerals slowly building up over time they need a few hundred years to be fully formed as we push further into the cave something unexpected catches our eyes these are deer bones they're estimated to be 500 years old there is one last challenge ahead an 80 m high carst wall called the Great Wall of Vietnam to reach there we must also pass through a 600 m long Passanddale passage the passage is now filled with water and is turned into a breathtaking jade green lake it's so high that the light does not reach to very top after the wall the light from the exit is visible from 500 meters away we have explored the world's largest cape from one end to the other yet on the fourth day of the exploration one mystery still remains which ancient creature the fossil we saw in Sondong belongs to i'm opening opera browser and quickly navigating to the cave's website to check the related article here we'll find the same fossil's image and its description i'm going to press command slash or control slash to open area it's a built-in AI tool let's ask it to highlight the key points in this article the article mentions two different coral fossils but doesn't specify which image belongs to which creature luckily Arya has image recognition feature i'm going to upload the image and ask again okay it identifies the fossil we saw etc corolia let's check for more information on this sea creature first I'm using the tab islands feature to effortlessly group tabs by topic and save space i can expand or collapse them as needed i'm splitting the browser window to view both websites side by side it appears that tetracoria or rugosa went extinct 300 million years ago this carnivorous species is believed to have had tentacles to catch its prey and grew up to 10 cm because it is extinct today we don't know exactly what this animal looked like but with Arya's image generation feature we can create a possible visual for this animal here's an illustration of a living tetracolia drawn as a colony with tentacles by the way tab traces feature as you can see here help us see our recent visited tabs by darkening the underscore the darker the underline the more recently the tab was visited using Opera smart tools I believe that we identified which creature this fossil belongs to opera also enhances workflow with a floating music player and customizable themes with many other features download Opera now from the link in the description box or pin comment to take your browsing experience to the next level
