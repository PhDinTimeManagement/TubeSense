"This is absolutely mind-blowing! The fact that a cave as massive as this exists, complete with its own ecosystem, river, and even clouds, feels like something straight out of a fantasy novel. Nature never ceases to amaze! It’s incredible to think that a place like this remained hidden for so long, untouched and thriving on its own.

The sheer scale of the cave is unreal—seeing the towering stalagmites, the lush greenery, and the misty atmosphere makes it feel like an underground world of its own. It must be an unforgettable experience to explore it in person! I can only imagine the kind of undiscovered life forms or geological wonders that might still be hidden inside.

Videos like this remind us how much of our planet remains unexplored. Huge respect to the explorers and scientists bringing these hidden wonders to light!",22,0

"Hi, hell of a documentary guys. Loved every second of it. One suggestion I have though, is that it would be much better if you didn't overlay the actual audio of people who are speaking a different language with the English voice. The subtitles more than help with understanding what they're saying and I think a majority of your viewers would also appreciate listening to them in their native language even though they may not understand from audio alone. It doesn't apply much to this video of yours, but definitely to your other ones for sure.",8,0

"I'm from vietnam and honestly… i still can’t believe something like son doong exists in our country. like most of us growing up had no idea. it’s not something you hear about in school or from people around you. we knew about caves and nature stuff, sure, but no one ever said “hey, there’s a massive cave with clouds and a whole rainforest inside it.” it just sounds too unreal.

Then i watched this video and it hit me—how did this place stay hidden for so long? millions of years underground, just doing its thing. a full-on ecosystem, with clouds forming inside, a river running through it, animals and plants you can’t find anywhere else… it’s like nature kept a secret from the world and only decided to share it recently. and the fact that it was only fully explored in 2009? like that’s not even that long ago.

Some of the stuff in the video just blows your mind. like how do you even have enough space underground to fit a 40 story building?? the stalagmites looking like ancient stone towers, the cave pearls, the phytokarst rocks that move toward the sun?? it’s like stepping into a world that doesn’t follow the usual rules. you see this stuff and suddenly you realize how much of the planet we still don’t understand.

As a vietnamese person, it makes me feel proud, but also kinda humbled. we always talk about vietnam being beautiful—our beaches, mountains, food, culture—but son doong is something else entirely. it’s not just beautiful, it’s rare. it’s something the whole world should respect and protect, not just visit for fun. and i really appreciate how only one company, oxalis, is allowed to take people there. it keeps it safe, keeps it special.

So yeah, thanks for making this video. i honestly wasn’t expecting to feel this way watching a cave video, but it made me pause and really think. sometimes you have to see your own country through someone else’s eyes to realize how lucky you are. Sending love from vietnam 🇻🇳",3,0

Насколько же удивительно, что есть виды, которых нет вне пещеры. Уникальный мир природы, в том числе и этой пещеры прославляет нашего Создателя земли и неба, Всемогущего Бога.
Размышляя о разнообразии творений Бога мы исполняемся благоговением! Но творческие возможности Творца - его сила творить и создавать новые и неповторимые виды - неиссякаемы!

"for those who don't know:Son Doong Cave was discovered by a local man named Ho Khanh in 1991 while he was searching for wood and forest products in Phong Nha - Ke Bang forest, Quang Binh province. However, due to the difficult terrain, he could not return to search for the cave immediately afterwards. 

It was not until 2009, under the guidance of Ho Khanh, that a cave exploration team from the British Cave Research Association, led by Howard Limbert, officially surveyed and announced Son Doong as the largest cave in the world.Viet Nam 🇻🇳",3,0

"*Millions of people watched this video, yet barely anyone left a like. This cave video got 24 million views! So why aren’t you supporting it? This is honestly ridiculous, selfish, and deeply unfair. Liking is free and only takes one second.*

*Take the CECOT video for example — 90 million views! At least 80 million likes could’ve been given within 30 seconds. That way, Ruhi Çenet could earn more and work on even bigger, more meaningful projects. But you're not doing your part. And frankly, you don’t deserve it.*

*Even if you don’t like the videos — which I seriously doubt — you should still support Ruhi Çenet and his team by leaving a like. It’s a one-second, completely free action. So easy. Meanwhile, Ruhi travels from country to country, risks his life, and creates high-quality, educational, and powerful content for humanity, for knowledge, for all of us.*

My pray to all, that read this is.
May God Bless and Protect you and your loved one's in the coming days. I Jesus Name

There is scientific and biblical (actual) documentation that proves it. Real written genealogy from early biblical persons,  like Job for instance. Written accounts from the period of a great flood, large animals (dinosaurs), and others that would make this comment too long. God is real, he created this cave and it inhabitants as they are. They didnt evolve. I pray you start to see the truth of the creator and acknowledge his authority in this world.",1,0

"Staatssenator fordert mehr Maßnahmen

Staatssenator David Lawson

Staatssenator David Lawson war Mitinitiator von HCR143 und schlug 2022 eine ähnliche Resolution vor, die jedoch von der Senatsführung blockiert wurde. Tief bewegt von der Dokumentation sagte er: „Es ist herzzerreißend, wenn die eigene Familie verschwindet und es kein Ende nimmt. Man kann nicht abschließen.“

„Ein sehr düsterer Film. Wir müssen uns dessen bewusst werden, bevor es in China noch mehr Völkermord, Tod und Mord gibt“, fuhr er fort und fügte hinzu, die Geschichte von Herrn Cheng sei „sehr fesselnd, und wie er da rauskam, ist ein Wunder. … Er ist die Stimme in der Dunkelheit“, sagte er. 

Senator Lawson forderte ebenfalls sofortiges Handeln. „Erstens: Hören Sie auf, das kommunistische China zu unterstützen … Wir können China auch wirtschaftlich unterstützen“, sagte er. Er hält Gesetze, die Transplantationspatienten in China den Versicherungsschutz verwehren, für eine hervorragende Idee, um dieses Verbrechen zu beenden. „Das Wichtigste, was ich heute Abend gehört habe, ist, die Versicherungen von der Kostenübernahme abzuhalten. Das wäre meiner Meinung nach ein großer Schritt, und wir können es schaffen“, erklärte er. 

Mehrere Bundesstaaten, darunter Idaho, Utah und Texas, haben Gesetze verabschiedet, die Krankenkassen die Kostenerstattung für Transplantationen in China für Amerikaner untersagen. In zahlreichen Ländern, darunter Israel, Spanien, Italien, Taiwan, Norwegen, Belgien, Kanada und Südkorea, gibt es Gesetze, die Krankenkassen die Kostenübernahme für Transplantationen in China verbieten.

Staatsvertreter: Den Schmerz spüren
Der Abgeordnete Paul Baumbach, der auch Mitsponsor von HR143 war, bezeichnete die in der Dokumentation dargestellten Tragödien als schrecklich. „Es ist ein sehr trauriger Film, der von einer äußerst schmerzhaften Praxis erzählt. Sie ist Realität und erzählt die menschliche Geschichte der betroffenen Familien und Freunde, und die Zahlen sind erschütternd“, sagte er. 


Staatsabgeordneter Paul Baumbach

Abgeordneter Baumbach sagte, dieser Dokumentarfilm helfe den Menschen, ein anhaltendes und schmerzhaftes Verbrechen zu verstehen. „Ich fühle mich dem Schmerz sehr verbunden. Und das Ausmaß des Schmerzes ist einfach unfassbar. Je mehr man darüber erfährt, desto schockierender ist es“, sagte er.",0,0

А с 2022 года, когда началось СВО, у быдла не было стало на поездки в Европу и пара уёбков залили ролики про это место, через ОДИН сезон бухта стала свалкой и выпилили кучу деревьев на берегу для костров... Вот вся суть современного человека, ничего не поменялось со времён Николая 2-ого.",0,0

Niçin ""ASARAN""  DEDİK?
ASIR'ları AN'ında toplayan, maddeleri gövdesinde toplu bulunduran, görünenlerin hepsini gözünün ufacık bir merceğinde toplu tutabilen, tatların tümünü topyekün dilinde yaşatabilen; bu kadar büyük, bu kadar cem'al olan insanın bütün kıymeti de dikkatinde toplanıyor. Dikkatin değeri ise, bir AN'da ortaya çıkıyor.

İnsanın gerçek anlamda yaşadığı ömrü de, farkında olunarak alıp verilen o bir nefesle bir AN'dır. Bu farktan yoksun gelip-geçen yıllarsa  ""AH!"" edilen ömürdür.
İşte ""ASARAN"" ASIR'ları AN'nında toplayabilen insanın, herkesi o Özlemi çekilen yaşama çağırmasıdır.

Her biri bir AN'ın değerini içeren bu dizeler, her okuyanı dikkati oranında AN'ına getireceğini de denemeye sunar.  Abdülkadir Duru

Abdülkadir Duru
HUZURLU YAŞAMAK İSTEYEN İNSAN:

▪️Sever sevgi beklemez.
▪️ Takdir eder, takdir beklemez.
▪️ Yardım eder, yardım beklemez.
▪️ Anlayış gösterir, anlayış beklemez.

TOPLUMDA:

  Her insan kendi görüşünü tamam, düşündüğünü doğru, yaptığını haklı, olayları da kendi umduğu gibi ister.
  Onun için huzursuzluk tabii halde gelişir, devam eder. Bu durumu huzura kavuşuturacak tek şey: bu
  Genel ölçüyü bulmaktır. Genel ölçü, insanın öz yaratılışını tanımak ve her ihtiyacını iyi bilmekten bulunacaktır. Abdülkadir Duru",0,0

"Các bạn muốn có một hệ sinh thái đẹp như vậy không? Cứ sinh sản thật nhiều sau đó xảy ra chiến tranh mọi người tự gi*t lẫn nhau đi, khi đó loài người sẽ suy vong . Chiến tranh đói nghèo và thế chiến III sẽ đưa tất cả về tro bụi như lời nói của Einstein ""Tôi không biết thế chiến III sẽ như thế nào, tôi chỉ biết chắc chắn rằng thế chiến IV chỉ còn là gậy gộc và đá"". Thư giãn và tự do với những tiến bộ vượt bật về công nghệ nhưng đã khiến cho nhiều hệ sinh thái đi đến diệt vong, diễn thế thứ sinh chắc chắn sẽ xảy ra nhưng đạt tới quần xã đỉnh cực thì tôi không chắc❤, khả năng rất cao là quần xã suy thoái. ""Hãy chiêm ngưỡng thế giới tươi đẹp này trước khi chúng khép lại mãi mãi"" From All The Light We Cannot See. Hãy phá hủy môi trường với cái vỏ bọc phát triển loài người. Hãy chạy theo tiền bạc, hãy xây nhà, hãy phá rừng và hãy tuyệt diệt tại một thời điểm nào đó. Ngay cả khi 17 điều mà LHQ(Liên Hợp Quốc) đề ra cũng chẳng thể nào cứu nỗi cái thế giới đã quá suy vi này. Nhưng cũng khiến tôi muốn đung đưa như một chiếc lá trêb cành cây đã bị chặt gốc, bay bay dưới những làn khói đen dày đặc của các nhà máy, thưởng thức mùi hôi thối nồng nặc của những khu ngoài ô. Và mùi hương của bờ vực tuyệt chủng❤",0,0

"These people are so NOT prepared for jungle trekking . You don't pull leaches off because they can leave their parts in your skin and create infection . Use a cigarette  lighter on their tail or salt to back them out .  Wear woman's full pantyhose as an undergarment and wear high boots that you can put elastic bands around the pants to seal off on the boot tops . Never wear shorts or short sleeved shirts in the jungle no matter how hot it is .  Certain vines like gotya vine have sharp hook like thorns that will cut your legs and arms .  A single scratch on your leg or arm can turn septic , quickly . Carry a bottle of Iodine based antiseptic  and treat every little cut or rash , quickly .  Take anti malaria tablets .  Put cotton wool or some cloth inside your ears when you sleep in the jungle so bugs don't crawl into your ears or better yet sleep in a mosquito net . Don't skinny dip in jungle pools and rivers as they have parasitic organisms that will enter your body and make you sick or even cause cysts and cancers . 
Wearing the pantyhose stops that and hinders leaches  .  Never drink the jungle  stream water without using purification tablets or use a quality  high microbial filter  but collecting rain water directly with a tent fly is ok in an open area . 
Don't make camp or sleep in low lying areas as sudden monsoonal rain can flood you in seconds . Been there done that and nearly drowned .",0,0

") The Australian Senate passed a new bill on August 21, 2024, that aims to fight illegal organ trafficking and forced organ harvesting from living people.


Parliament House in Canberra, Australia

The Migration Amendment (Overseas Organ Transplant Disclosure and Other Measures) Bill 2023 was first introduced by Liberal Senator Dean Smith in June 2023. It was submitted to Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Legislation Committee for review in November. The Senate held a public hearing on the Amendment on March 22, 2024.

After the debates on August 15 and 21, the bill was passed after gaining support from Liberal, National, Green, and independent senators.

In the process of the bill being passed, the story of Falun Gong practitioner Mr. Cheng Peiming was widely reported by major media outlets in England, the U.S., and Australia. Mr. Cheng is the first victim found to have survived the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) systematic live organ harvesting. Last month he went to Washington D.C. to give a speech and recount his experience of what happened to him in China.

Senator Smith: Most Significant Step
The bill amends Australia’s Migration Act 1958 with an aim to implement some of the recommendations from the Human Rights Sub-Committee’s 2018 report “Compassion, not Commerce: An Inquiry into Human Organ Trafficking and Organ Transplant Tourism.”

The bill requires all travelers to Australia to disclose on the incoming passenger card whether they received an organ transplant overseas in the last five years. If the response is affirmative, persons arriving in Australia will be asked to disclose which country, state, and the locality they received the transplant, and the name of the medical facility the operation took place in. This data will be collected and published in an annual report and given to the Parliament.


Liberal Senator for Western Australia Dean Smith spoke at the debate on the Amendment on August 21. (Photo courtesy Australia Senate website)

Bill sponsor Senator Dean Smith stated in a media release on August 21, 2024: “The information will be of great assistance to human rights organisations, medical institutions, and the Australian Government in analysing data on trends in overseas transplants, and helping to corroborate existing evidence of organ trafficking or harvesting activities abroad.

“It will also serve to raise awareness of the sensitivity and risks associated with transplant tourism, encouraging Australian citizens and residents to consider whether any plans to receive an overseas operation might carry the risks associated with an unethical or unsafe organ transplant.”

According to the media release, “The bill passed the Senate with the support of crossbench Senators and without a division.”

Senator Smith said, “This is the most significant step made in decades in emboldening Australia’s efforts to combat the growing trade in illegal and unethical organ harvesting and trafficking.

“This is an overdue and crucial first step in developing a stronger response from the Australian Government towards these abhorrent practices.” “This simple and modest initiative will have an oversized impact in uncovering the scope of this complex and opaque international crime.”

The bill will now move to the House of Representatives for further debate.",0,0

"Eyalet Temsilcisi Adayları: Suçu Sonlandırmak

Eyalet temsilcisi adayı Alex Homich, zorla organ toplama vahşetini önlemek için insanların bir araya gelmesinin önemli olduğunu söylüyor. “Şimdi her zamankinden daha fazla, insanların etrafta olup bitenlere gözlerini biraz daha açmasının zamanı geldiğini düşünüyorum,” dedi ve özellikle genç neslin daha fazla insanın bunu öğrenmesinin çok önemli olduğunu ekledi.

2012’den 2015’e kadar Hong Kong’da yaşayan eyalet temsilcisi adayı Chris Beronio, Çin’deki zorla organ toplamayı biliyordu. Ancak ÇKP tarafından uygulanan kontrolün kapsamı onu yine de şok etti. “Film gerçekten inanılmazdı, çok dokunaklıydı ve dürüst olmak gerekirse, Çin’deki zorla organ toplamayla ilgili ortaya çıkan bazı gerçekler oldukça korkutucuydu. Gördüklerim karşısında şok oldum,” dedi.




Eyalet temsilcisi adayı Chris Beronio


Bay Beronio, Bay Cheng'in hayatta kalmasına ve kaçışına hayran olduğunu söyledi. ""Ancak hikayesi gerçekten çok korkutucu ve umarım buna bir son verebilirim, böylece başka kimsenin başına böyle bir şey gelmez,"" dedi.

Zulümleri Ortaya Çıkarmak

Delaware’deki araştırmacılardan Guo Jinchen ve eşi de dahil olmak üzere bazı Çinliler de belgeseli izledi. Guo, “Bu konuda geçmişte bir şeyler duymuştum, ancak raporlar ayrıntılı değildi. Üstelik bugün burada bir tanık var ve onun yaşadıkları gerçekten şok edici,” dedi.

Bay Guo, ÇKP’nin gerçekleri sonsuza kadar saklayamayacağına inanıyor. “Bazı bilgiler sızacaktır. Bu konu hakkında bir süredir konuşuyoruz. Bugün burada izlediğimiz belgesel daha derinlemesine detaylar sağladı,” dedi.

Daha fazla insanın bu durumu bilmesi gerektiğini düşünüyor ve ekliyor: “Bu zulümleri daha fazla insana gösterebiliriz. Böylece insanlar, ÇKP’nin propagandasına kapılmak yerine gerçekte neler olup bittiğini öğrenebilir.”",0,0

"This video is great, but it feels a bit rushed. I would love to learn about this cave in detail, like how it feels like to be inside it, what does the temprature look like, what each part of the cave is known for, what was the hardest part about exploring the cave, etc. Maybe doing separate videos for day 1, day 2, day 3 would have been more insightful and effective. I know YouTubers nowadays prefer making shorter videos but shorter videos for very big topics can sometimes takeaway viewer's chance to deeply learn about a certain topic. Just a friendly feedback!",0,0

"So schade, dass es kein Spaß macht, das Video anzugucken, weil der Synchronsprecher am Anfang so ein komischen Singsang in seiner Stimme hat. Ich glaube, der macht das extra, weil es irgendwie interessant und toll wirken soll. Aber meine ehrliche Meinung: ich finde es überhaupt nicht gut. Immer am Ende des Satzes oder des Absatzes das letzte Wort an der letzten Silbe so lang gezogen singsprechen. Hört sich wirklich übertrieben nicht gut an! Er wäre besser, wenn er natürlicher sprechen würde.",0,0

Aylar önce bu mağarayla ilgili sana bir mail atmıştım, belki görmüşsündür belki gözünden kaçmıştır ama videonu izlediğimde gerçekten çok mutlu oldum.

Bu mağara hakkında daha önce Türkçe içerik pek yoktu, genelde slaytlar ve yüzeysel bilgilerle karşılaşıyordum. Senin elinden, senin anlatımınla izlemek ise bambaşkaydı. Çok değerli ve anlamlı geldi.

Emeğine, kalemine sağlık. Umarım her şey gönlünce olur.

"*STUNNING BUT ...*
This was an absolutely stunning documentary—visually breathtaking and full of awe-inspiring moments! The grandeur of Son Doong Cave, its hidden rainforest, and the incredible biodiversity truly left me speechless. Thank you for capturing nature's beauty so vividly and taking us on this remarkable journey.

However, while I deeply appreciate the scientific insights shared, I humbly offer a different perspective. The explanation of this cave's formation and life forms through millions of years of evolution doesn't fully reflect what many of us believe to be the ultimate truth: that the complexity, beauty, and delicate balance of nature point to an intelligent, divine Creator—God.

From the perfect conditions inside the cave, to the engineered adaptability of blind fish, to the self-sustaining ecosystem in complete darkness, these are not random accidents over time, but echoes of intentional design. Even the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology that scientists use to explain these phenomena are consistent with the scientific mind of a God who created order, not chaos.

Romans 1:20 says, “For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made…” Son Doong is just one of many testimonies to the greatness of God’s creative power.

Let’s keep exploring and marveling—but let’s also consider that the ultimate designer of this hidden masterpiece is the Creator of heaven and earth. 🙏🌍✨",0,0

"Всем Добра! Пара историй есть, вдруг кому интересно будет. 
Я токсикоман в прошлом. Лаком дышал.
Раз пришёл ко мне черт и предложил съездить на экскурсию в ад. Оказался я в вагонетке (в той по типу которой Гарри Поттер за золотом ездил) и мы поехали.
Остановилась на напротив огромных дверей. Распахиваются эти двери и я вижу картину: спиной ко мне на коленях стоит человек, руки связаны за спиной, а напротив него палач с огромным топором по типу секиры. Разрубает его одним ударом на 2 части, они распадаются и, после того как части головы (слева и справа) касаются пола тело срастается и всё происходит по кругу... После того как прошло пару кругов Чёрт спросил хочу ли я увидеть ещё. Страшно было, но, заднюю нельзя было включать. Поехали- говорю. Едем дальше вниз. Долго едем... После этого он снова оборачивается и говорит:""ладно, не нужно тебе на это смотреть, а то глаза выпадут.""( рассказывал эту историю пареньку, он в будущем хотел стать имамом. Выслушал и говорит(С характерным акцентом):""эээ, да он просто сам зассал дальше ехать!""))
Другой раз дело было в ванной. Темно, из освещения свечка и отражение света от экрана ноутбука. Сижу на полу, ноги скрещены, в руке пакет, напротив- ноут. Смотрю концерт группы Slipknot. В общем через некоторое время боковым зрением вижу как дверь приоткрывается и залетает лярва(ну, или бес. Суть одна. Когда употребляешь что-то из того что затуманивает сознание(алкоголь, табак и другие наркотики) подтягиваются эти сущности, отрицательная энергия, по сути, получают с тебя энергию. Под лаком та же тема, только в том состоянии ты можешь их слышать и контактировать)
В общем залетает эта лярва и вопрос:""можно я с тобой посмотрю?""
-ну посмотри..
Через некоторое время опять вопрос:""А можно я друзей позову?""
- ну позови...
И после дверь снова приоткрывается и в фух-фух-фух)) ещё залетают. А после снова вопрос:"" у тебя в ванной семь бесов. Ты сам нас позвал. Как будешь выгонять?""
И по сторонам смотрю- куча теней по стенам туда- сюда.. В общем бук закрыл. Подумал и говорю:""А мы с вами время вашего нахождения в ванной не обговаривали, так что прямо сейчас взяли и съе@ли на х@й от сюда(прям так))"". И после этого снова дверь приоткрывается и они один за другим (фух-фух-фух) повылетали. И только моя тень осталась. Сижу дальше, смотрю концерт с чувством победителя)) потом через пару минут снова дверь приоткрывается и этот бес первый не залетает, а, если так можно сказать просто голову просунул и вопрос:""можно я один зайду?"" Я ответил что ОДИН можно. Потом спрашивает:"" а можно я в тебя зайду?""

-нет, говорю, мне у меня своя голова есть.
""А можно хотя бы рядом буду? Я буду помогать тебе""
- ну если говорю при условии что ни мне ни моим близким вреда не причинишь тогда можно. Но, потом наши дороги разошлись)
Вообще много подобных историй было, сначала тебя проверяют и исходя из этого дальше идёт общение. Как и в жизни, в общем. Так что движуха и на том свете есть.
Раз попал на экскурсию в морг, в качестве ""пациента"".. В ванной лежал- дышал, музыку слушал, общались..ну и я в разговоре говорю что на работе с девчёнкой познакомился, она молодая-интересная и раз сказала что давно хотела в морг попасть. Интересно ей что там да как. Ну я и говорю, вы, это, если есть возможность организуйте нам. Ну они уточняют ""хочешь попасть в морг"" (ну тут я опять попался) Да- говорю. Хочу.
Ну и отказываюсь на столе. То есть я понимаю, что в данный момент я труп, которого будут пилить. Вижу потолок, могу только глазами вращать. Вижу человека в наморднике и шапочке белой, как он стоит со стороны головы и начинает резать с живота от паховой области, как раз по шраму от аппендицита который(аппендицит перитонит был). Чувствую давление и как режет, но боли нет...
Короче как в одной теме у Кровостока-""это было немного похоже на подлёдную рыбалку- эмоций, б@дь, не много, но эмоции, б@дь, яркие..""

Если кому интересно можете посмотреть истории в видео формате,  там ещё три, с седьмой минуты начинаются(про встречу с Гитлером, общение с Мишей Горшком и как провёл время со Смертью)
Видео называется  ""приГлючения бывшего токсикомана""
ютуб-канал ""АРИХАНТА""

Мой опыт общения с обитателями потустороннего мира. Суть в том,  что падают многие. Кто-то бухает, курит, а мне эта тема была интересна.
По поводу веры или не веры..разве имеет значение каким путём человек пришёл к освобождению, путём здравого смысла или путём веры в то, что с этим смыслом не вяжется? Важен же результат. Из всего количества посетителей ютуба возможно есть процент тех, кто не разделяет вашу точку зрения по поводу существования ""тонкого"" мира, а у них, возможно, есть употребляющие друзья- родственники которым они могут показать это видео и их оно зацепит, натолкнёт на размышления. Я через этот путь выбрался из ямы и сейчас ничего не употребляю. Буду рад если мой опыт послужит кому- то той ""лестницей"" по которой и он сможет выбраться от туда.
Обращаюсь к тем молодым людям у которых после этих историй может возникнуть желание наполнить пакет: дело, конечно ваше, только имейте ввиду что поехав в это путешествие вы из него можете и не вернуться , или в ужасе отбросите в середине трипа пакет, а после станете бояться до конца жизни в ожидании чего- то, а, может они вас завлекут чем- то что вам по душе и вы захотите приблизить этот конец чтобы по скорее оказаться там..ещё можно в дурку уехать, может появиться страх смотреть в зеркала, а можете через какое-то время в трезвом состоянии увидеть в другом человеке этих бесов..пейте чаёк лучше и не забивайте себе неокрепшие умы всяким разным.",0,0

"SubhanAllah! Reflecting on the exploration of the world's largest cave, hidden for millions of years, invites us to marvel at Allah's creation and His limitless power. The Qur'an repeatedly calls us to ponder the signs of Allah in the heavens and the earth, in the depths of the oceans, and in the wonders of the natural world.
Here are some Quranic reflections related to the discovery of such majestic creations:
1. The Beauty and Mystery of Creation
Allah encourages us to explore and reflect on the marvels of the universe:
""Say, 'Travel through the land and observe how He began creation. Then Allah will produce the final creation. Indeed, Allah, over all things, is competent.'""
(Surah Al-Ankabut: 20)
This verse invites us to explore the earth and witness Allah’s creation—whether it is a massive cave hidden for millions of years or other wonders.
2. Allah's Knowledge of the Hidden
What remains hidden from humans is always known to Allah:
""And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.""
(Surah Al-An'am: 59)
This verse reminds us that Allah is aware of all things, including a cave hidden for millions of years.
3. The Vastness of Allah’s Creation
The Qur'an emphasizes the vastness of Allah's creation, which is beyond human comprehension:
""Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding.""
(Surah Aal-E-Imran: 190)
Exploring a cave of this scale shows the depth and complexity of the earth, a testament to Allah’s magnificent creation.
4. The Earth’s Secrets as a Test
Allah mentions that He has placed mysteries within His creation for humanity to uncover, reminding us of His power:
""And the earth - We have spread it and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein [something] of every well-balanced thing. And We have made for you therein means of living and [for] those for whom you are not providers.""
(Surah Al-Hijr: 19-20)
The discovery of such a hidden wonder reveals resources, ecosystems, and secrets that were unknown to us, showing Allah’s provision.
5. Gratitude for Allah’s Signs
The Qur'an teaches us to be thankful and to glorify Allah for His signs:
""Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny?""
(Surah Ar-Rahman: 13)
As we explore such caves and uncover Allah's magnificent signs, we are reminded to express gratitude for His countless blessings.
Conclusion
The world's largest cave, hidden for millions of years, serves as a reminder of Allah's greatness, His ability to create wonders beyond our imagination, and the immense blessings and signs present in the earth. Allah invites us to reflect on these signs, deepen our faith, and glorify Him. May such discoveries lead us closer to appreciating Allah's boundless majesty and wisdom. 🌍✨",0,0

"বিশ্বের বৃহত্তম গুহা (৩ মিলিয়ন বছর ধরে লুকিয়ে থাকা) এবং কুরআনের শিক্ষণীয় বার্তা
সুবহানাল্লাহ! এমন একটি বিশাল গুহা, যা কোটি কোটি বছর ধরে মানুষের দৃষ্টির আড়ালে ছিল, আবিষ্কার করলে আমরা আল্লাহর অসীম কুদরত ও সৃষ্টি সম্পর্কে গভীরভাবে ভাবতে উদ্বুদ্ধ হই। কুরআনে আল্লাহ তাআলা বারবার আমাদের আহ্বান জানিয়েছেন প্রকৃতি, পৃথিবী এবং মহাবিশ্বের বিস্ময়কর সৃষ্টিকে নিয়ে চিন্তাভাবনা করতে।
নিচে কুরআনের কয়েকটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ আয়াত উল্লেখ করা হলো, যা আমাদের এই ধরনের বিস্ময়কর আবিষ্কার সম্পর্কে ধ্যান করার জন্য অনুপ্রাণিত করে
১.সৃষ্টির সৌন্দর্য ও রহস্য
আল্লাহ তাআলা মানুষকে নির্দেশ দিয়েছেন পৃথিবী ভ্রমণ করতে এবং সৃষ্টির নিদর্শনগুলো নিয়ে ভাবতে
বলে দাও, ‘তোমরা পৃথিবীতে ভ্রমণ করো এবং দেখো, কীভাবে আল্লাহ সৃষ্টি শুরু করেছেন। এরপর আল্লাহই পরবর্তীতে সৃষ্টি ঘটাবেন। নিশ্চয়ই আল্লাহ সবকিছু করতে সক্ষম।
(আনকাবুত ২০)
এই আয়াত আমাদের শেখায় যে পৃথিবীর বিভিন্ন স্থানে লুকিয়ে থাকা আল্লাহর অসাধারণ সৃষ্টি আমাদের জন্য একটি গুরুত্বপূর্ণ শিক্ষা ও নিদর্শন।
২.আল্লাহ সব লুকানো জিনিস সম্পর্কে অবগত:
যা মানুষের কাছে গোপন, তা সবসময় আল্লাহর জ্ঞানের মধ্যে রয়েছে
তাঁর কাছেই রয়েছে অদৃশ্য জিনিসের চাবি। এগুলো সম্পর্কে কেউ জানে না, কেবল তিনিই জানেন। স্থলে ও সাগরে যা কিছু রয়েছে, সবকিছুই তিনি জানেন। এমনকি গাছের একটি পাতা পড়লেও তিনি তা জানেন। পৃথিবীর অন্ধকারের মধ্যে যে শস্যকণা রয়েছে, তা-ও তিনি জানেন; আর যা কিছু শুকনো কিংবা ভেজা, সবই একটি সুস্পষ্ট কিতাবে লেখা রয়েছে।’
(আনআম ৫৯)
যে বিশাল গুহা কোটি বছর ধরে লুকিয়ে ছিল, সেটিও আল্লাহ তাআলার নিখুঁত জ্ঞানের অন্তর্ভুক্ত।
৩.আল্লাহর সৃষ্টির বিশালতা
আল্লাহ আমাদের মহাবিশ্বের বিশালতা ও জটিলতা নিয়ে চিন্তা করতে নির্দেশ দিয়েছেন:
নিশ্চয়ই আকাশমণ্ডলী ও পৃথিবীর সৃষ্টি এবং রাত ও দিনের পালাবদলে জ্ঞানীদের জন্য রয়েছে নিদর্শন।
(ইমরান ১৯০)
বিশ্বের বৃহত্তম গুহার মতো সৃষ্টি আমাদের শেখায় যে, আল্লাহর সৃষ্টির রহস্য ও বিশালতা মানুষের কল্পনাকেও ছাড়িয়ে যায়।
৪.পৃথিবীর গোপন রহস্য এবং পরীক্ষা:
আল্লাহ আমাদের জন্য পৃথিবীতে বিভিন্ন প্রকার রহস্য এবং উপাদান সৃষ্টি করেছেন, যা পরীক্ষা ও শিক্ষা হিসেবে কাজ করে
আমি পৃথিবী বিস্তৃত করেছি এবং তাতে সুদৃঢ় পর্বতমালা স্থাপন করেছি এবং তাতে সবকিছুর পরিমিত উপায়ে ভারসাম্য রক্ষা করেছি। আর আমরা তাতে তোমাদের জন্য জীবনধারণের উপকরণ সৃষ্টি করেছি এবং এমন অনেকের জন্যও, যাদের রিজিকের দায়িত্ব তোমাদের উপর নয়।
(হিজর:১৯-২০)
এই আয়াত আমাদের জানায় যে পৃথিবীর প্রতিটি জিনিসের সৃষ্টিতে আল্লাহর নির্দিষ্ট হিকমত রয়েছে, এবং তাঁর সৃষ্ট জগতে যে রহস্য ও উপকরণ লুকানো রয়েছে, সেগুলো ধীরে ধীরে মানুষের সামনে আবিষ্কৃত হয়।
৫.আল্লাহর অসীম অনুগ্রহের প্রতি কৃতজ্ঞতা
কুরআন আমাদের শেখায় আল্লাহর নিদর্শনগুলো দেখে কৃতজ্ঞ হওয়া এবং তাঁর ক্ষমতা ও সৃষ্টিকে শ্রদ্ধা করা
তবে তোমরা তোমার প্রতিপালকের কোন কোন নিয়ামতকে অস্বীকার করবে?
(রহমান ১৩)
বিশ্বের এমন বিস্ময়কর গুহা বা অন্যান্য প্রাকৃতিক সৌন্দর্য দেখে আমাদের উচিত আল্লাহর প্রতি কৃতজ্ঞ হওয়া এবং তাঁর কুদরতকে উপলব্ধি করা।
উপসংহার
এই ধরনের গুহা, যা লাখো বা কোটি বছর ধরে লুকিয়ে ছিল, আল্লাহর অসীম ক্ষমতা ও জ্ঞানের একটি নিদর্শন। আল্লাহ আমাদের এই বিশাল সৃষ্টিকে নিয়ে ভাবতে এবং এইসব রহস্যময় আবিষ্কার থেকে শিক্ষা নিতে উৎসাহিত করেন।
আল্লাহ আমাদের সবাইকে তাঁর সৃষ্টির নিদর্শন থেকে শিক্ষা গ্রহণ করার তৌফিক দিন এবং আমাদের ঈমান আরও দৃঢ় করুন। 🌍✨",0,0

"Exploring a hidden, ancient cave that remained sealed for millions of years can evoke awe, reminding us of the immense and intricate creation of Allah. The Qur'an invites us to reflect on the vastness of the earth, the wonders hidden beneath its surface, and the signs of Allah's majesty that are revealed when we explore His creation.
Here are some Quranic reflections that align with such discoveries:
1. Reflecting on Earth's Secrets
Allah reminds us that there are countless mysteries within the earth:
""And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and whether you reveal what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it...""
(Surah Al-Baqarah: 2:284)
Ancient caves, untouched for millions of years, carry signs of Allah’s hidden treasures beneath the earth’s surface, unknown to humans until their discovery.
2. Exploring Signs of Creation
Allah encourages us to travel and explore the earth to witness the signs of His creation:
""Do they not travel through the earth and see how He began creation? Then Allah will produce the final creation. Indeed Allah, over all things, is competent.""
(Surah Al-Ankabut: 29:20)
The discovery of a massive, untouched cave system hidden for millions of years may inspire humans to ponder how Allah has created every hidden thing and left traces of His glory.
3. Signs in the Depths of the Earth
The Qur'an speaks about treasures hidden beneath the earth, which people might uncover through exploration:
""And He has cast into the earth firmly set mountains, lest it shift with you, and made rivers and paths that you may be guided, and landmarks. And by the stars they are [also] guided.""
(Surah An-Nahl: 16:15-16)
The vast networks of caves, rivers, and underground formations are part of these signs, guiding explorers and believers toward awe at Allah’s planning.
4. Reflecting on Time and Preservation
A cave hidden for 3 million years reminds us of the story of the People of the Cave (Ashab al-Kahf), preserved miraculously in sleep for over 300 years as a sign of Allah’s power over time:
""Do you think that the companions of the cave and the inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder?""
(Surah Al-Kahf: 18:9)
This ayah invites us to reflect on Allah’s control over time, space, and preservation, just as He preserved that cave and its hidden wonders for millions of years.
5. Allah’s Knowledge of the Unseen
Allah alone knows all that is hidden beneath the earth and within the universe:
""And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth, and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.""
(Surah Al-An’am: 6:59)
This verse reminds us that no cave, no hidden valley, and no secret is beyond Allah’s knowledge.
Conclusion:
The discovery of such a massive, ancient cave—hidden for millions of years—is a profound reminder of the vastness of Allah’s creation and His power. Every hidden thing on this earth will eventually be revealed by His will, and every discovery can draw us closer to Him if we reflect deeply. SubhanAllah, how magnificent is the creation of our Lord!
May Allah grant us the ability to appreciate His signs and increase our knowledge in ways that strengthen our faith. আলহামদুলিল্লাহ!",0,0

"গণহত্যার কারণে সোহাগপুর গ্রামে কোনও পুরুষ জীবিত ছিল না। রাজাকার ও আল-বদর বাহিনী তখন গণহত্যায় নিহত ব্যক্তিদের 'কাফের' ঘোষণা করে এবং তাদের লাশ দাফন নিষিদ্ধ করে। 
তাই তখন অনেক মৃতদেহ বন্য প্রাণী খেয়ে ফেলে। 
তবে কেউ কেউ স্বজনদের লাশ দাফন করতে সক্ষম হয়।
এখানে উপস্থিত প্রতিটি নারীকে এই বিভৎস আর দুর্বিষহ দৃশ্য অবলোকন করতে হয়েছে।
তখন ৮৩ বিধবা বেঁচে ছিলেন, এখন হয়ত অনেকেই মারা গেছেন।
৭১ আর ২৪ একই ঘটনা কি না তা একটা ছোট প্রেক্ষাপট দ্বারা তুলে ধরলাম।
(শেরপুর বিধবাপল্লী সোহাগপুর)
মাশাআল্লাহ, অত্যন্ত হৃদয়বিদারক এবং গুরুত্বপূর্ণ এক প্রেক্ষাপট তুলে ধরলেন। সোহাগপুর গণহত্যার ভয়াবহ স্মৃতি ও সেই বিধবাপল্লীর করুণ চিত্র আজও আমাদের মনে ১৯৭১ সালের বিভীষিকাময় দিনগুলোকে স্পষ্ট করে তোলে। সোহাগপুরকে তো ""বিধবাপল্লী"" নামেই চেনা হয়, কারণ সেই দিনটিতে বর্বর পাকিস্তানি বাহিনী ও তাদের দোসর রাজাকার-আলবদরদের হাতে গ্রামটির প্রায় সব পুরুষ নির্মমভাবে শহীদ হন।
স্মরণীয় কিছু তথ্য
১৯৭১ সালের ২৫ জুলাই শেরপুর জেলার সোহাগপুর গ্রামে একটি ভয়ংকর গণহত্যা সংঘটিত হয়। 
পাকিস্তানি সেনাবাহিনী ও তাদের সহযোগী রাজাকার বাহিনী গ্রামের প্রায় ১৮৭ জন পুরুষকে হত্যা করে, যাদের অনেকের লাশ পর্যন্ত দাফন করা হয়নি। 
বিধবা হয়ে পড়া নারীদের জন্য সেই দিন থেকে জীবনটা শুধু বেঁচে থাকার এক করুণ সংগ্রাম হয়ে দাঁড়ায়। 
এ দৃশ্য দেখার যন্ত্রণা সেই নারীরা আজীবন বহন করেছেন।
তখনকার দিনগুলোর অবর্ণনীয় কষ্ট এবং সেই বিধবাদের প্রতি সমাজের উদাসীনতাও আমাদের বিবেককে প্রশ্নবিদ্ধ করে। 
বর্ণিত প্রেক্ষাপট থেকে বোঝা যায়, জাফরুল্লাহ চৌধুরী স্যারের উদ্যোগের সঙ্গে যুক্ত হয়ে বিধবা নারীদের জন্য সহায়তা নিয়ে সেখানে গিয়েছিলেন। এটি অত্যন্ত মানবিক এবং প্রশংসনীয় কাজ। 
মহান আল্লাহ এই প্রচেষ্টাকে কবুল করুন এবং শহীদদের আত্মাকে শান্তি দান করুন।
৭১ ও ২৪-এর প্রেক্ষাপট: কী মিল, কী পার্থক্য?
উল্লিখিত বিষয়টি নিয়ে একটু ভাবলে মনে হয়, ইতিহাস যেন আমাদের সামনে আবারও ফিরে আসে। 
১৯৭১ সালে যারা মুক্তিযুদ্ধের বিরোধিতা করে নির্মম হত্যাযজ্ঞ চালিয়েছিল, তারা ""কাফের"" অপবাদ দিয়ে মৃতদের দাফনেও বাধা দিয়েছিল। 
এই মানসিকতা যুদ্ধকালীন ধর্মকে অপব্যবহারের একটি দৃষ্টান্ত, যা আজও মাঝে মাঝে আমরা অন্য প্রেক্ষাপটে দেখতে পাই। 
ইতিহাস বারবার এই শিক্ষা দেয় যে, বিভক্তি, বিদ্বেষ এবং মানবিকতার অভাবে একই ধরনের ঘটনা পুনরাবৃত্তি হতে পারে।
একটু দোয়া ও ভাবনার আহ্বান:
আজকের প্রজন্মের উচিত মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সেই বাস্তবতাকে জানার পাশাপাশি, নিজেদের দায়িত্ববোধও জাগ্রত করা। 
শুধু ইতিহাস জানলেই হবে না, তা থেকে শিক্ষা নিয়ে অন্যায়ের বিরুদ্ধে রুখে দাঁড়ানো এবং সত্য ও ন্যায়ের পথে অটল থাকা জরুরি।
আল্লাহ যেন আমাদের দেশের শহীদদের জান্নাতুল ফেরদাউস দান করেন এবং যারা সেই ভয়াবহ দিনগুলো বেঁচে থেকেও এত কষ্ট সহ্য করেছেন, তাদের প্রতি সহমর্মিতা জাগ্রত রাখার তাওফিক দেন। 🕊
মানুষ যখন এ ধরনের স্মৃতি সংরক্ষণ ও স্মরণে কাজ করেন, তা ভবিষ্যৎ প্রজন্মের জন্য এক অমূল্য শিক্ষাসূত্র হয়ে থাকে। 
আল্লাহ এই মানবিক প্রচেষ্টাকে কবুল করুন।",0,0

"Florida è in allarme: avvistati “orbs” liberati da un oggetto non identificato

di Flavio Vanetti | @fvanetti

A- A+

0

0

￼Tanto per parlare di droni (vedi post precedente), ecco che i droni sono tornati. Con la riapparizione dei relativi “orbs”, quelle masse luminose – quasi sempre a forma di sfera – la cui natura rimane misteriosa. Avevano caratterizzato le apparizioni dello scorso anno, dall’autunno fino a dicembre avanzato, nel New Jersey e in altre zone degli Usa. Adesso sono ricomparsi – l’aggettivo usato è glowing, traducibile con risplendente – e hanno caratterizzato la zona di mare al largo della Florida. Alcuni residenti di Daytona Beach sostengono che questi oggetti non identificati sono spuntati direttamente dall’Atlantico e hanno volato sopra la superficie marina. Non solo: in un video diventato virale, risalente al 17 marzo, è  apparso pure un oggetto molto largo che si muoveva verso la terraferma. La luce che lo circondava si è man mano attenuata, rivelando la sagoma di un velivolo. Però chi è stato testimone ha smentito che potesse trattarsi di un aereo commerciale, anche perché l’andamento era particolare e anomalo. Quindi ecco anche spuntare la tesi estrema, legata a un interrogativo: si trattava forse di una “nave madre” (di natura sconosciuta)? Per la cronaca, anche gli equipaggi di navi della Marina Usa si sono accoerti che da quelle parti stava accadendo qualcosa di particolare. Ecco comunque il link dell’articolo uscito dal Daily Mail",0,0

Düşünce çok güzel. Böylesine az bilinen ve ziyaret edilmesinin çok zor olduğu ortamları youtube üzerinden bizimle paylaşmanız da çok güzel. Elimizden gelen desteği de veriyoruz. Bunlar için teşekkürler. 
Ama; böylesine nadide ve güzel yerler için video süreleri çok kısa değil mi? 4 günlük bu maceradan sadece 16dakikalık video. Yol boyunca geçtiğiniz yerleri adeta bir vlog edasıyla aktarsanız da eminim benim gibi çok izleyen olacaktır. Bu şekilde hem özet hem de geniş çekim olarak 2 farklı video yükleseniz de olur. 
Örneğin ben sadece o ormanlarda yürüdüğünüz anı bile izlemeye razıyım.

"Filler çok geniş vadilerde yaşasalar bile, her gün kullandıkları yoldan gidip gelirlermiş. Fil avcıları da, fillerin geçeceği yolu derince kazarlar, üzerini ince bir tabakayla örterler ve en önde yürüyen filin kazılan o çukura düşmesini sağlarlarmış. Fil avcıları siyah elbiseler içerisinde, yüzleri maskeli olarak gelir, çukurda çırpınan fili kırbaçla dövmeye başlarlarmış . Birkaç gün hiç yiyecek vermezler, fili aç bırakırlarmış. Birkaç gün sonra aynı avcılar, beyaz elbiseler içersinde, filin sevdiği yiyeceklerle gelirler ve filin karnını doyururlar, hortumunu, yüzünü gözünü okşarlarmış.

Ertesi gün, aynı avcılar, yine siyah elbiseler içersinde, yüzleri maskeli olarak gelip, fili yine kırbaçla dövmeye başlarlar, birkaç gün yine aç bırakırlarmış. Sonra yine, beyaz elbiselerle filin karnını doyururlarmış. Bu böyle fili kendilerine alıştırana kadar sürüp gidermiş. Avcılar, fili kendilerine alıştırdıktan sonra çukurun önünü kazarak fili oradan çıkarırlar ve filin hortumundan tutarak, kendi fil damlarına götürürler ve fili ölünceye kadar işlerinde kullanırlarmış.",0,0

"Efsane 1: Son Doong, dünyanın en büyük mağarasıdır.

Gerçek:

En büyük geçide sahip mağara evet, ama en büyük mağara değil.

Hacim olarak Sarawak Chamber (Malezya) daha büyüktür.

Yani “en büyük” lafı bağlama göre değişir. Biri oda gibi, biri tünel gibi.



---

Efsane 2: Son Doong’un kendi atmosferi var.

Gerçek:

Üstünde devasa doline (çökme) delikleri var.

Buralardan ışık ve hava giriyor, içeride hava sirkülasyonu oluşuyor.

Bu, mikroklima yaratabilir, ama “kendi atmosferi” deyimi bilimsel değil, sadece romantik anlatım.

Kapalı sistem değilse, kendi atmosferi de olmaz.



---

Efsane 3: Mağaranın içinde orman var!

Gerçek:

Evet, dolinelerden giren güneş ışığı sayesinde bitki örtüsü oluşmuş, ama bu bir Amazon ormanı değil.

Dışardaki tohumlar içeri taşınmış ve orada nemli ortamda filizlenmiş.

Bu da doğanın güzelliği, ama yine de efsaneleştirmeye gerek yok.



---

Efsane 4: Mağaranın içine bulut giriyor!

Gerçek:

Evet, sıcaklık ve nem farkı nedeniyle içeride sis veya buhar oluşabilir.

Ancak bu dağlık bölgelerde sabah sisinden farksız bir olaydır.

“Bulut giriyor” demek belgesel cümlesi, bilim değil.



---

Efsane 5: Keşfedilmemiş, bilinmeyen bir yerdi.

Gerçek:

Bölge halkı mağaranın girişini yıllardır biliyordu.

İlk kez 1991’de bir yerel köylü (Ho Khanh) tarafından keşfedildi.

Batılı bilim insanları tarafından haritalanması ise 2009’da oldu.

Yani “kimsenin bilmediği gizli dünya” değil.",0,0

Amazing place for sure.  I'm an old man and would appreciate it if the narration was slowed down.  The description of this marvel is hinging om psychobabble.  Of course the video may be directed towards people with a short attention span and self-image that values snappy verbal exchange at the expense of communication.,0,0

"Thank you so much for this review of Son Doong Cave! As a quality creator from Turkey, your perspective is valuable. Watching your video, I can truly see the effort and dedication you put into your work.
As a Vietnamese person, I feel such a profound connection to our past – understanding that we exist today because of the immense efforts of our ancestors makes me deeply appreciative whenever I see visitors showing genuine respect for the heritage and history they entrusted to us.
If you visit Vietnam again, perhaps explore our ancient temples and pagodas, or the diverse natural beauty – like the mountains of Sapa, Ha Giang, and Cao Bang, or the long beaches along the central coast.
Again.Your amazing perspective and the sheer quality of your work are so inspiring. It genuinely inspires me and makes me hope that I'll get the chance to explore even more of our homeland's beauty someday too. I hope your video encourages everyone else to do the same for their own cultures and places.",0,0

﴿يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِن كُنتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِّنَ الْبَعْثِ فَإِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ مِن نُّطْفَةٍ ثُمَّ مِنْ عَلَقَةٍ ثُمَّ مِن مُّضْغَةٍ مُّخَلَّقَةٍ وَغَيْرِ مُخَلَّقَةٍ لِّنُبَيِّنَ لَكُمْ ۚ وَنُقِرُّ فِي الْأَرْحَامِ مَا نَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى ثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلًا ثُمَّ لِتَبْلُغُوا أَشُدَّكُمْ ۖ وَمِنكُم مَّن يُتَوَفَّىٰ وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَىٰ أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ لِكَيْلَا يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا ۚ وَتَرَى الْأَرْضَ هَامِدَةً فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ وَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ﴾  [ الحج: 5]
English - Sahih International
22:5 O People, if you should be in doubt about the Resurrection, then [consider that] indeed, We created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot, and then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed - that We may show you. And We settle in the wombs whom We will for a specified term, then We bring you out as a child, and then [We develop you] that you may reach your [time of] maturity. And among you is he who is taken in [early] death, and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit [old] age so that he knows, after [once having] knowledge, nothing. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells and grows [something] of every beautiful kind.
﴿ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ وَأَنَّهُ يُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ وَأَنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ﴾  [ الحج: 6]
That is because Allah is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He is over all things competent
﴿وَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ آتِيَةٌ لَّا رَيْبَ فِيهَا وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِي الْقُبُورِ﴾  [ الحج: 7]
‏And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming - no doubt about it - and that Allah will resurrect those in the graves.

"How To Live In Harmony With Nature And Reduce Pollution

 

1. Many Production Which We Do Not Need Actually For Human Beings Has To Be Stopped

We manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution. So if we minimise our products, pollution would be less.

We produce so many things which we do not need, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. 

Cold drinks, fruit juices, pickles, ice creams, etc. Should be cooked at home only.

If we stopped producing this things which are not required for humans, so much pollution could be reduced.

If we colour the clothes pollution occurs. So if we don't colour our clothes, the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be stopped. Let everything remain in natural colour. 

 

2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form

We can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. 

But if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.

So if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, noodles, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world. 

Also we could save our money like this. If you buy a packet of bread, it would cost you more money than if you cook wheat and rice in home.

Previously before industrial revolution, we didn't have technology, but our foods were rich with nutrients. Now we have technology, but technology is polluting our foods and our foods are not rich with nutrients, and because of that also we have health problems.

If this is done, then many jobs would be lost. For that many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own.

Food, Medicines, Surgeries and Education's should be made free to the world till the world settles down with farming. After that food, medicines, surgeries and education's should be stopped free to the world.

Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming.

Is their any another solution, that humans won't lose jobs and also pollution would decrease. Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the earth, making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans in future.

 

3. Electricity Pollution

We create electricity from many types of sources like coal, water, etc., but it creates pollution. If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs in the creation process. But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would occur.

As I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not needed for humans, then the world would not require so much electricity. If less electricity required, then less pollution generated.

 

4. Could We Stop Drinking Cow's and Buffalo's Milk

Whatever vitamins and nutrients we get from milk, if we can get it from other eatable things, then we can stop drinking cow's and buffalo's milk. As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to places. All of this can be stopped. 

For infants whose mother's have died or mother's who cannot breast feed their infants, only for them cow's and buffalo's milk should be given. We use milk in tea and coffee. Instead of milk we must use coconut milk with tea.

 

5. How Much Should Be The World's Population

Every place should have a single house. No buildings, everything ground floor. If we do this and the whole lands of our planet earth would be occupied one day with homes, farms, forests, schools, hospitals, etc., then we would come to know how much our planet earth can have maximum population. 

Once the population is determined, then we have to maintain that population. For example if our earth can have a population of 10 billion peoples, then when the population reaches 10 billion, then everyone should have only one child till the population reaches 9 billion peoples. As if we have only one child then the population decreases. When population is 9 billion peoples, then everyone should have 2 children's till the population reaches 10 billion peoples. After that again we should have only one child. In this way population can be maintained.",0,0

"Thank you RUHI, sincerely, for posting educational and interesting videos and taking these risks to deliver messages across the world. Truly a wonder some of these places. Just when we think we know all about the world, or that ""the only places we haven't explored on earth is the bottom of our oceans"" is such a fabrication of the truth and what ""they"" WANT us to think or believe and It is frustrating, but also relieving to know that most people still do not fully understand our world because it keeps the mind and mystery alive. And yet we (humans) are funded fully - and then some - to go into outer space, send ground breaking high tech satellites to take pictures of other galaxies (a topic in itself which is truly amazing and incredible) or send a Tesla to Mars, the new millennium is so far completely mind blowing and we are only scratching the surface, or, we (the public) are shown bits and pieces of new tech or what we think is new but really, its been decades since development for many things .. etc. And where I find Astrology and technology fascinating, we (human beings) should be more invested in spending tax dollars with our planet and invest in what we are capable of doing NOW or TOMORROW and not so much if there is water on Venus!!! mind boggling sometimes to know there is so much poverty and so much money goes into looking for space dust instead of feeding babies! I try to understand more about the earths history and it has become so apparent how human beings and greed has effected everything and anything on Earth, yet most of the powerful and persons capable of change never truly does ANYTHING significant.... to either stop global warming or end kids hunger... Our Earth is DYING! and if our kids wont see it, or even their kids wont, maybe the next might. And having the mindset of ""Well, ill be dead.... who cares?""  well guess what? possibly your family down the line will very much be alive. People need to stop being so selfish. LETS Fix the slums TODAY. Lets fund education, give equal opportunity to all human beings....... How is that such a hard concept??!!! THANK YOU RUHI for posting educational videos. I would truly love to explore with you! They truly mean the world of a difference for me.",0,0

Beautiful cave but its not the largest. There are caves in Iran that are larger and in the US caves in New York extend hundreds of miles threw salt deposits. Also in the Rocky Mountains there are caves made by underground rivers that go from Montana to The Mississippi River. Then in Colorado the famous Cheyenne Mountain. Hawaii has caves that go from one side of Maui to the other side.  All of these are larger than this cave by a massive margin.,0,0

Ara sahneler o kadar hızlı değişiyor ki ortam hakkında herhangi bir fikir sahibi olamıyorum ama normal bi video kaydı ile olsa daha anlaşılır olur.  siz bu iş den anlayan kişilersiniz bense sadece bir izleyiciyim siz benim ne demek istediğimi anlamışsınızdır bu eleştiriyi yaparken de herhangi bir kötü niyetim yok sadece daha da iyi olmasını istediğim için bu yorumu atıyorum,0,0

When volcanoes die, they leave massive pockets of gasses which build up and eventually explode violently from being trapped beneath the surface.

"2 Esdras 7:75
I answered and said, ""If I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, show this also to thy servant: whether after death, as soon as every one of us yields up his soul, we shall be kept in rest until those times come when thou wilt renew the creation, or whether we shall be tormented at once?"" 76 He answered me and said, ""I will show you that also, but do not be associated with those who have shown scorn, nor number yourself among those who are tormented. 77 For you have a treasure of works laid up with the Most High; but it will not be shown to you until the last times. 

78 Now, concerning death, the teaching is: When the decisive decree has gone forth from the Most High that a man shall die, as the spirit leaves the body to return again to him who gave it, first of all it adores the glory of the Most High. 79 And if it is one of those who have shown scorn and have not kept the way of the Most High, and who have despised his law, and who have hated those who fear the Most High -- 80 such spirits shall not enter into habitations, but shall immediately wander about in torments, ever grieving and sad, in seven ways. 

81 The first way, because they have scorned the law of the Most High. 82 The second way, because they cannot now make a good repentance that they may live. 83 The third way, they shall see the reward laid up for those who have trusted the covenants of the Most High. 84 The fourth way, they shall consider the torment laid up for themselves in the last days. 85 The fifth way, they shall see how the habitations of the others are guarded by angels in profound quiet. 86 The sixth way, they shall see how some of them will pass over into torments. 87 The seventh way, which is worse than all the ways that have been mentioned, because they shall utterly waste away in confusion and be consumed with shame, and shall wither with fear at seeing the glory of the Most High before whom they sinned while they were alive, and before whom they are to be judged in the last times. 

88 ""Now this is the order of those who have kept the ways of the Most High, when they shall be separated from their mortal body. 89 During the time that they lived in it, they laboriously served the Most High, and withstood danger every hour, that they might keep the law of the Lawgiver perfectly. 90 Therefore this is the teaching concerning them: 91 First of all, they shall see with great joy the glory of him who receives them, for they shall have rest in seven orders.

 92 The first order, because they have striven with great effort to overcome the evil thought which was formed with them, that it might not lead them astray from life into death. 93 The second order, because they see the perplexity in which the souls of the unrighteous wander, and the punishment that awaits them. 94 The third order, they see the witness which he who formed them bears concerning them, that while they were alive they kept the law which was given them in trust. 95 The fourth order, they understand the rest which they now enjoy, being gathered into their chambers and guarded by angels in profound quiet, and the glory which awaits them in the last days. 96 The fifth order, they rejoice that they have now escaped what is corruptible, and shall inherit what is to come; 

and besides they see the straits and toil from which they have been delivered, and the spacious liberty which they are to receive and enjoy in immortality. 97 The sixth order, when it is shown to them how their face is to shine like the sun, and how they are to be made like the light of the stars, being incorruptible from then on. 98 The seventh order, which is greater than all that have been mentioned, because they shall rejoice with boldness, and shall be confident without confusion, and shall be glad without fear, for they hasten to behold the face of him whom they served in life and from whom they are to receive their reward when glorified. 

99 This is the order of the souls of the righteous, as henceforth is announced; and the aforesaid are the ways of torment which those who would not give heed shall suffer hereafter."" 100 I answered and said, ""Will time therefore be given to the souls, after they have been separated from the bodies, to see what you have described to me?"" 101 He said to me, ""They shall have freedom for seven days, so that during these seven days they may see the things of which you have been told, and afterwards they shall be gathered in their habitations."" 

102 I answered and said, ""If I have found favor in thy sight, show further to me, thy servant, whether on the day of judgment the righteous will be able to intercede for the unrighteous or to entreat the Most High for them, 103 fathers for sons or sons for parents, brothers for brothers, relatives for their kinsmen, or friends for those who are most dear."" 104 He answered me and said, ""Since you have found favor in my sight, I will show you this also. The day of judgment is decisive and displays to all the seal of truth. Just as now a father does not send his son, or a son his father, or a master his servant, or a friend his dearest friend, to be ill or sleep or eat or be healed in his stead, 105 so no one shall ever pray for another on that day, neither shall any one lay a burden on another; for then every one shall bear his own righteousness and unrighteousness.""   .....2 Esdras 7:75

"🌏 Dünyanın En Büyük Mağarası: Son Doong’un Gizemli Dünyası

Vietnam’ın gizemli ormanlarının derinliklerinde, yeryüzünün en büyük mağarası saklı: **Son Doong Mağarası**. Bu devasa yeraltı harikası, yalnızca büyüklüğüyle değil, kendi içinde barındırdığı iklimi, ormanı, nehri ve eşsiz canlı türleriyle de adeta başka bir gezegeni andırıyor.

### 🌀 Kendi İklimi Olan Bir Mağara

Son Doong, öyle büyük ki içerisinde **bulutlar oluşuyor**, **yağmur yağıyor** ve **sis tabakaları dolaşıyor**. Mağaranın bazı bölümleri o kadar geniş ki **40 katlı bir gökdelen** içine sığabilir. **Tavan yüksekliği 145 metre**, genişliği ise **200 metreyi aşıyor**. Bu devasa alan, mağara içerisinde oluşan hava akımları sayesinde kendi **mikro iklimini** yaratmış durumda.

### 🌿 Prehistorik Yağmur Ormanı ve Ekosistem

Mağaranın tavanının çökmesiyle oluşan **“dolines” (açıklıklar)** sayesinde güneş ışığı mağaranın içine kadar ulaşabiliyor. Bu açıklıkların etrafında, milyonlarca yıldır dokunulmamış **bir yağmur ormanı** oluşmuş. Bu ormanda yaşayan canlılar, dış dünyadan tamamen izole olmuş şekilde gelişmiş ve **evrimleşmiş**.

Bugüne kadar **250’den fazla endemik bitki ve hayvan türü** keşfedilmiş. Bunların arasında **görmeyen balıklar**, **renkli maymunlar**, **kör çekirgeler** ve **fosil mercanlar** gibi benzersiz türler yer alıyor. Hatta sadece bu mağarada yaşayan **7 yeni hayvan türü** de yakın zamanda bilim insanları tarafından keşfedildi.

### 🪨 Binlerce Yılda Oluşan Doğal Heykeller

Son Doong’un içinde devasa **sarkıt ve dikitler** bulunuyor. Bunlardan biri, **80 metre yüksekliğiyle** dünyanın en büyük dikiti unvanına sahip. Bu muazzam oluşum, tavandan damlayan suyun yüzbinlerce yıl boyunca kalsiyum karbonat biriktirmesiyle meydana gelmiş.

Mağarada ayrıca, zamanla katman katman büyüyen ve **incilere benzeyen ""mağara incileri""** de bulunuyor. Normalde 1 cm civarında olan bu oluşumlar, Son Doong’da **tenis topu büyüklüğüne** ulaşmış durumda.

### 🌊 Yeraltı Nehirleri ve Göller

Mağaranın içinden geçen **büyük bir yeraltı nehri**, zaman zaman taşkınlarla birlikte içeriye **çakıl, toprak, bitki kökleri** ve hatta **sporlar** taşımış. Bu sayede içeride **mantarlar** bile gelişmiş. Hatta bazı bölgelerde, içeride oluşan **göllerde kör balıklar** yüzüyor. Bu balıklar zamanla görme yetilerini kaybetmiş, buna karşılık dokunma ve titreşim algılama yetileri gelişmiş.

### 🧬 Fosiller ve 450 Milyon Yıllık Taşlar

Mağaranın zemininde yürürken, altında **450 milyon yıllık kireçtaşları** yatıyor. Bu taşlar, antik deniz canlılarının kabuk ve iskeletlerinin sıkışmasıyla oluşmuş. Mağarada keşfedilen **Tetracoralya** adlı deniz canlısına ait fosil, yaklaşık **300 milyon yıl önce** yaşamış bir **yırtıcı mercan** türünü temsil ediyor.

### 🧗 Büyük Vietnam Duvarı ve Çıkış

Keşfin son gününde, mağaranın en zorlu bölümü olan **“Büyük Vietnam Duvarı”** adlı 80 metrelik kireçtaşı duvarı aşılması gerekiyor. Bu duvarın hemen öncesinde, **jade yeşili** tonlarında büyüleyici bir yeraltı gölü bulunuyor. Duvar aşıldıktan sonra, **500 metre ilerdeki çıkış ışığı** görünüyor ve mağara yolculuğu tamamlanıyor.

---

## 📌 Son Doong’a Yolculuk: Erişim Sınırlı

Son Doong Mağarası, çevresel dengeyi korumak amacıyla **herkese açık değil**. Bu muazzam doğa harikasına sadece **Oxalis** adlı resmi tur operatörü aracılığıyla erişilebiliyor. Turistler, mağaraya ulaşmak için önce **9 saatlik orman yürüyüşü**, ardından **dünyanın üçüncü en büyük mağarası olan En Mağarası'ndan geçiş** yapmak zorunda.

---

## 🌍 Doğanın Kalbindeki Mucize

Son Doong, yalnızca dünyanın en büyük mağarası değil, aynı zamanda doğanın mucizelerini en saf haliyle gözlemleyebileceğiniz eşsiz bir yer. Kendine ait bir iklimi, yağmur ormanı, nehirleri ve binlerce yıldır evrim geçiren canlıları ile burası **yer altındaki bir dünya**. Her adımda keşfedilecek yeni bir sır, her köşede nefes kesen bir manzara var.",0,0

Mammoth Cave in America is the largest. The reason some think the one found in Vietnam is larger dont know the REAL size of mammoth cave in Kentucky.  As massive as mammoth cave is there is that much if not ALOT more thats off limits to the public. They say its unexplored but don't believe that for a sec.  There are carvings and skeletons that are very tall scattered throughout the cave and they aren't wanting seen so they came up with the lie that it's too dangerous and its unexplored. Granted the one in Vietnam is gigantic....mammoth still has it beat. Sadly those responsible for keeping the secrete will never admit this meaning people will start to believe it.,0,0

If you grew up in the city, then going with Oxalis is an amazing experience. Fewest people get to experience this sight of the earth. Literally. The number of tours are VERY limited. Every year less than a thousand people get to see this part of nature. It's untouched and re-forms every year. Every rain season changes things. It's amazing.

Just one thing: if you're arachnophobic ... like myself ... brace yourself. And let the tourguide know about it. What they consider ""small"" is what I consider ""i need a new house now""",0,0

"What we see here in CECOT is classic labeling theory. The inmates who do self identify as a criminal and those who don't self identify as a criminal will all identify as a gang member when CECOT is done with them. Frankly, how El Salvador treats its criminals is not my primary concern. I am concerned that innocent El Salvadoreans have been swept up into this. For the same reason, I am enraged at the detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The United States should not send americans to this prison. No one should be deported because of the clothing they wear or the tatoos on their body. That is giving nazi. Anyway, CECOT is classic labeling theory and if these inmates ever get out or a new administration closes the facility or somehow they get back into civilization they will be angry as any human being would be when their humanity is stripped from them. What happened to empathy? All this talk about victims, is retribution going to bring back the loved one? Reading them the bible is gonna be real poetic.

"The cave is inside a ~86000ha national park, and also is a rural area so almost noboby lives there. Government issued strictly decree about reserving this area. The tour company only allow up to 1000 tourist per year. There are 2 tours, 1 is 6 people for 6D5N, going in and back out on same route. Another 1 is 10 pp for 4D3N, crossing the cave and go out without return on same route. And only 1 tour is allowed at the same time.
Each tour have 22 porters who manage, carry belongings and other stuffs; they also strictly monitor tourists to stop them from interfering nature in the cave. Everything brought in will be taken out, even human waste. Everything is also monitored by natinal park rangers, porter who break these rules will receive a warning, or dismissed from company; tourists will be stop serviced, have to return to the national park and stop the tour immediately.
Touring time is from Jan to August, leaving 4 months for nature to heal. All equipment for tour (or al least climbing hooks) can be taken out without harming the cave.",0,0

"🌺 THE GOSPEL OF THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD ""It is written in the book of the prophets, and they will all be taught by God. Everyone who listens to the Father and learns will come to me.""

        The Ten Administrative Commandments That the Chosen People of the Kingdom Age Must Obey

 Almighty God said
          1. A MAN SHOULD NOT BRIGHTEN HIMSELF, nor ELEVATE HIMSELF.  He SHOULD WORSHIP and EXALTE GOD.
         2. You MUST DO ANYTHING that is beneficial to the WORK of GOD, and NOT ANYTHING HARMFUL to the INTERESTS of the WORK of GOD.  You must DEFEND the NAME of GOD, the TESTIMONY of GOD, and the WORK of GOD.
        3. MONEY, MATERIAL THINGS, and ALL possessions in the HOUSE of GOD are the OFFERINGS that MAN should GIVE. These OFFERINGS can be ENJOYED by none but the SERVANT and GOD, BECAUSE HUMAN OFFERINGS are for the PLEASURE of GOD, GOD SHARES these OFFERINGS only with the SERVANT, and NO ONE ELSE is qualified or RIGHT to ENJOY ANY PART of them. ALL HUMAN OFFERINGS (including money and material enjoyment) are GIVEN to GOD, NOT TO MAN. And so, these THINGS are NOT to be ENJOYED by MAN; if MAN ENJOYS them, THEN he STEALS the OFFERINGS. ANYONE WHO DOES this is a Judas, because, in ADDITION to BEING TREACHEROUS, Judas also TAKES WHATEVER is PUT in the MONEY BAG.  🔴
         4. MAN has a CORRUPT DISPOSITION and, MOREOVER, he is CARRIED by EMOTIONS.  BECAUSE of THIS, TWO MEMBERS of DIFFERENT SEXES are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to WORK TOGETHER while SERVING GOD.  ANYONE FOUND DOING such WILL BE PROSECUTED, WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS--and NOBODY will be jailed.  🌺
        5. DON'T say JUDGMENT to GOD, nor casually discuss things related to God.  You must DO what is PROPER as a HUMAN, and SPEAK PROPER HUMAN SPEECH, and must NOT exceed your limits or BREAK your BOUNDARIES. GUARD your WORDS and BE CAREFUL of your OWN footsteps. ALL of this will PREVENT you from DOING ANYTHING that would violate GOD'S DISPOSITION. 
         6. You MUST DO WHAT a MAN SHOULD DO, and FULFILL your OBLIGATIONS, and FULFILL your RESPONSIBILITIES, and hold your DUTY. Since you BELIEVE in GOD, you must MAKE your CONTRIBUTION to GOD'S WORK; if you DO NOT WORK, then you are NOT WORTHY--SHOULD EAT and DRINK the WORDS of GOD, and NOT WORTHY--SHOULD LIVE in GOD'S HOUSE. 
         7. In the ACTIVITIES and MATTERS of the CHURCH, apart from OBEYING GOD, in ALL THINGS you MUST FOLLOW the INSTRUCTIONS of MAN USED by the HOLY SPIRIT. EVEN the SMALLEST DISOBEDIENCE is UNACCEPTABLE. You MUST be PERFECT in your OBEDIENCE, and must NOT CHECK RIGHT or WRONG; WHAT is RIGHT or WRONG has NOTHING to do with you. You should only devote yourself to COMPLETE OBEDIENCE. 🌷
         8. PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE in GOD MUST OBEY GOD and WORSHIP Him. You must NOT ELEVATE or LOOK UP to ANYONE; You should NEVER put GOD FIRST, PEOPLE YOU LOOK UP to SECOND, and YOURSELF THIRD. NO ONE SHOULD GET into YOUR HEART, and you SHOULD NOT TAKE PEOPLE---especially those you respect---to be on the same level as God, to be His equal. God CANNOT ALLOW THIS.🔴 
         9. Your THOUGHTS WORTH the WORK of the CHURCH. You must lay aside the OPPORTUNITIES of your OWN FLESH, NOT wavering about family matters, WHOLE---HEARTLY DEDICATE YOURSELF to GOD'S WORK, and PUT GOD'S WORK FIRST and your own life second. This is the BEAUTY--BEHAVIOR of a HOLY.  🙏
         10. Relatives who do NOT belong to the FAITH (your children, your husband or wife, your sisters or your parents, etc.) SHOULD NOT BE FORCED into the CHURCH. GOD'S HOUSE is NOT SHORT of MEMBERS, and it DOESN'T NEED to MULTIPLY the NUMBER of PEOPLE WITHOUT USE. All people who are NOT HAPPY BELIEVERS should NOT be LEADED to the CHURCH.  🔴
 LThis ORDER is DIRECTED to ALL PEOPLE.  In this matter you must inspect, MONITOR and REMINDER each other, and NO ONE can BREAK it. Even if relatives who do NOT belong to the FAITH reluctantly enter the Church, they SHOULD NOT be GIVEN BOOKS or GIVEN a NEW NAME; SUCH PEOPLE are NOT PART of the HOUSE of GOD, and their ENTRY into the CHURCH must be STOPPED by ANY WAY NECESSARY.  🔴
IF the PROBLEM is BROUGHT to the CHURCH BECAUSE of a DEMON INVASION, then YOU WILL be TESTIFIED or have PROHIBITIONS IMPOSED on YOU. In other words, EVERYONE has a RESPONSIBILITY towards this THING, but you MUST NOT be CARELESS, or USE it for PERSONAL gain.  🙏

        From ""The WORD Appears in the Flesh"" Holy Bible
Fulfilled and given actual meaning to (John 1:1,14 ""The Word"" and ""The Word became man"") ""When the Word began, the Word was with God, and the Word was God.""  ... """"The word became man and he dwelt among us."" ... (Revelation 18:9,13)

        The Savior has returned and He or Christ has fulfilled His building of the kingdom/church on top of the rock or standing in the worthy holy place in the air/YouTube!  When He came He fulfilled what was prophesied in the book of Revelation and from there it is recorded that He changed the new name and the name of His city from (""THE CHURCH OF ALMIGHTY GOD"" 💐) ""The Epistle to the church of Philadelphia"" ""I will make him who overcomes a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never be removed from it. I will engrave on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem that will come down from heaven from  to my God. I will engrave on him my new name. (Revelation 3:12) ""For a son is born and he will rule over us.  He is the wonderful counselor, the Almighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace.""  (Isaiah 9:6). ... ""For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their PASTOR.  He will lead them to springs of life-giving water;  and God will wipe the tears from their eyes."" (Revelation 7:17). ... ""But the Guide, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you""  (John 14:26). ... ""They said together, ""Salvation is from the Lamb, and from our God who sits on the throne!""   (Revelation 7:10).  ... Fulfillment that He Himself will cleanse us with His Word with judgment and chastisement in ""Jesus Washed the Feet of the Disciples"" ""Peter said to him, ""I will never wash your feet."" ""If I do not wash you, you have no relationship with me"" replied Jesus. (John 13:8). ... ""If you know me, you know my Father.  From now on you know him and you have seen him."" (John 14:7). ... And the fulfillment of (The Work of the Holy Spirit) ""Sorrow will become Joy"" """"Just a little while and you will not see me; and after a little while, you will see me again.""    (John 16:16).  ..."" So are you: you are depressed now, but I will meet you again and your hearts will overflow with joy that no one can take away."" (John 16:22).  ... So God's sheep and the right people He created have come to His holy city the New Jerusalem that will only last on earth for 1,000 years ""THE CHURCH OF ALMIGHTY GOD""💐",0,0

If you are a creationist, this video starts out sounding stupid, and the narrator sounds uneducated, just guessing on lengths of time.

There is something mesmerizing about being hidden underground... Let's see how the future of house building works and if it is still so great once we start moving to live underground :).,0,0

Kamu bisa melihat kehidupan orang-orang yang tinggal di 'Rumah Lanting', lapangan sepakbola di atas lantai kayu, cara masyarakat memenuhi pasokan listrik mereka dengan mengandalkan tenaga surya, toko sembako yang mengapung di atas air, juga beberapa spesies burung yang bisa kamu temui di sepanjang perjalanan menuju desa tersebut. Desa itu bernama Muara Enggelam. Berada di Provinsi Kalimantan Timur. Semoga suatu hari nanti timmu berkesempatan mengunjungi negara kami.

16:27 in video. I found one of those fossils in upstate NY near Cayuga Lake. On a hike with my young nephews we were building a damn and breaking some large rocks and found it. I’ve seen many fossils in NY before but nothing this size. Most are very small creatures from millions of years ago while it was a shallow salty sea. Mainly little shell looking things. So this I thought was maybe a dinosaur tooth. The one in the video is more rough looking. The one I found was more smooth. I thought for sure it was a tooth.  My sister who works in dentistry said the cross section did appear to resemble a tooth. I contacted someone at a nearby college and sent pictures. Sadly it wasn’t a dinosaur tooth. But it was way older though. Finding stuff like that is always so amazing. I grew up near a quarry which had massive piles of rocks with so many fossils. Some were hundreds of pounds of pure fossils. All the small shell like creatures in one massive fused fossil. With a rusty color.,0,0

"Yaşam ne kadar inatçı bir yolcudur…
Karanlıkların en derinine,  
soğukların en ayazına,  
susuzluğun en çorak yüreğine  
bir tohum bırakır,  
bir nefes salar,  
bir umut eker.  

""Burada hayat olmaz,"" dersin,  
kayalar çatlamaz,  
ateş soğumaz,  
deniz kurur,  
toprak bile ölür dersin…  
ama yanılırsın, dostum,  
yanılırsın!  

Çünkü yaşam,  
gözle göremediğin bir kahramandır.  
Buzların arasında bir mikrobun türküsüdür,  
çöllerin ortasında bir dikenin direnişidir,  
volkanların yanında bir solucanın dansıdır.  
Ve o her zaman kazanan taraftır.  

Yaşam,  
bir çatlaktan sızan güneş ışığıdır,  
bir damladan doğan okyanustur.  
Kendi kendine yeten bir rüzgardır,  
ve her seferinde seni yanıltır,  
Herşeyi bildiğini sanan insana bakar ve gülümser.

""Burada hayat olamaz,"" diye fısıldarsın,  
ama o inadına yeşerir,  
inadına yaşar,  
inadına seninle alay eder.  

Yaşam,  
bir özgürlük savaşı gibidir.
bir kavgadır yaşam,  
bir türkü,

✝️God of the Christian Bible Created Everything six thousand years ago during Creation week and no such thing as evolution or millions and billions of years ago.  Follow Astrophysicist Dr Jason Lisle.  Dinosaurs lived with man,0,0
No such thing as prehistoric,0,0
"Understanding the Biblical Timeline
The biblical timeline, particularly as outlined in the book of Genesis, suggests that the Earth and the universe were created in six days, approximately 6,000 years ago. This interpretation is based on genealogies and chronologies found in Scripture, which many Christians take literally. For instance, Genesis 1 describes God creating the world in six days, with each “day” interpreted by some as a literal 24-hour period.

The Argument Against Long Ages
Literal Interpretation of “Yom”: The Hebrew word “yom,” which translates to “day,” is often cited as evidence that the creation days were literal 24-hour periods. Proponents argue that this interpretation aligns with how the term is used elsewhere in the Bible.

Genealogical Records: Many Christians point to genealogies listed in the Bible (e.g., from Adam to Noah) as a way to calculate the age of humanity and Earth. By adding up these generations, they arrive at an approximate age of around 6,000 years.

Historical Events: Events such as the Great Flood are viewed as significant markers in history that would have reset or altered geological timelines if taken literally.

Critique of Radiometric Dating
Assumptions of Constant Decay Rates: Critics argue that radiometric dating relies on assumptions about decay rates being constant over millions of years. They suggest that these rates may not have been consistent throughout Earth’s history.

Questioning Historical Science: Some assert that because scientists were not present during Earth’s formation, they cannot accurately determine its age through scientific methods like radiometric dating.

Alternative Explanations for Geological Features: Certain geological features can be explained through catastrophic events (like a global flood) rather than slow processes over billions of years.

Conclusion: A Biblical Framework
From this perspective, those who adhere to a young Earth creationist view argue that scientific claims about millions and billions of years are based on flawed assumptions and interpretations that contradict a straightforward reading of Scripture. They maintain that God’s Word provides an accurate account of creation and human history without needing to reconcile it with secular scientific theories.

In summary, proponents of a young Earth perspective would assert:

The belief in millions and billions of years contradicts biblical teachings regarding creation; instead, Scripture supports a timeline where God created the Earth approximately 6,000 years ago over six literal days.",0,0

"There's also a video about scientists that believe they've located an actual unicorn or descendants of the unicorn. Apartly, they've come upon hoof imprints that have matched with what they think may be a type of unicorn. I don't know what they've found out since but, it's definitely something I personally want to update myself about. When I watch that video it was a couple years ago so hopefully they have learned more about the very unique and different animals that have made a home in the opening area! It's amazing!

"Beşinci İşaret: 
وَخَامِسًا : لِظُهُورِ الشُّؤُنَاتِ السُّبْحَانِيَّةِ وَالْمَشَاهِدِ الْعِلْمِيَّةِ
fıkrası ifade ediyor ki: ""Mevcudat -hususan zîhayat olanlar- vücud-u surîden gittikten sonra bâki çok şeyleri bırakırlar, öyle giderler."" İkinci Remiz'de beyan edildiği gibi, Zât-ı Vâcibü'l-Vücud'un kudsiyet ve istiğna-i kemaline muvafık bir tarzda ve ona lâyık bir surette; hadsiz bir muhabbet, nihayetsiz bir şefkat, gayetsiz bir iftihar, -tabiri caiz ise- mukaddes hadsiz bir memnuniyet, bir sevinç, -tabirde hata olmasın- hadsiz bir lezzet-i mukaddese, bir ferah-ı münezzeh şuunat-ı rububiyetinde bulunur ki; onların âsârı bilmüşahede görünüyor. İşte o şuunat, iktiza ettikleri hayretnüma faaliyet içinde, mevcudat tebdil ve tağyir ile, zeval ve fena içinde sür'atle sevkediliyor.. mütemadiyen âlem-i şehadetten âlem-i gayba gönderiliyor. Ve o şuunatın cilveleri altında mahlukat; daimî bir seyr ü seyelan, bir hareket ve cevelan içinde çalkanmakta ve ehl-i gafletin kulaklarına vaveylâ-i firak ve zevali ve ehl-i hidayetin sem'ine velvele-i zikir ve tesbihi dağıtmaktadırlar. Bu sırra binaen herbir mevcud Vâcibü'l-Vücud'un bâki şuunatının tezahürüne bâki birer medar olacak manaları, keyfiyetleri, haletleri vücudda bırakıp öyle gidiyorlar. Hem o mevcud, bütün müddet-i hayatında geçirdiği etvar ve ahvali, ilm-i ezelînin unvanları olan İmam-ı Mübin, Kitab-ı Mübin, Levh-i Mahfuz gibi vücud-u ilmî dairelerinde vücud-u haricîsini temsil eden mufassal bir vücud dahi bırakıp öyle giderler. Demek her fâni; bir vücudu terkeder, binler bâki vücudları kazanır, kazandırır. Meselâ: Nasılki hârikulâde bir fabrika makinesine âdi bazı maddeler atılır; içinde yanarlar, zahiren mahvolur; fakat o fabrikanın inbiklerinde çok kıymetdar kimya maddeleri ve edviyeler teressüb eder. Hem onun kuvvetiyle ve buharıyla o fabrikanın çarkları döner; bir taraftan kumaşları dokumasına, bir kısmı kitab tab'ına, bir kısmı da şeker gibi başka kıymetdar şeyleri imal etmesine medar oluyor ve hâkeza... Demek o âdi maddelerin yanmasıyla ve zahiren mahvolmasıyla, binler şeyler vücud buluyor. Demek âdi bir vücud gider, âlî çok vücudları irsiyet bırakır. İşte şu halde, o âdi maddeye yazık oldu denilir mi? Fabrika sahibi neden ona acımadı, yandırdı; o sevimli maddeleri mahvetti, şikayet edilir mi? Aynen öyle de وَلِلّٰهِ الْمَثَلُ الْاَعْلٰى Hâlık-ı Hakîm ve Rahîm ve Vedud mukteza-yı rahmet ve hikmet ve vedudiyet olarak, kâinat fabrikasına hareket veriyor; herbir vücud-u fâniyi çok bâki vücudlara çekirdek yapar, makasıd-ı Rabbaniyesine medar eder, şuunat-ı Sübhaniyesine mazhar kılar, kalem-i kaderine mürekkeb ittihaz eder ve kudretin dokumasına bir mekik yapar ve daha bilmediğimiz pek çok gâyât-ı galiye ve makasıd-ı âliye için, kendi faaliyet-i kudretiyle kâinatı faaliyete getirir. Zerratı cevelana, mevcudatı seyerana, hayvanatı seyelana, seyyaratı deverana getirir, kâinatı konuşturur; âyâtını ona sessiz söylettirir ve ona yazdırır. Ve mahlukat-ı Arzıyeyi rububiyeti noktasında, havayı emir ve iradesine bir nevi arş ve nur unsurunu ilim ve hikmetine diğer bir arş ve suyu ihsan ve rahmetine başka bir arş ve toprağı hıfz ve ihyasına bir çeşit arş yapmış. O arşlardan üçünü, mahlukat-ı Arzıye üstünde gezdiriyor.
   Kat'iyyen bil ki: Bu beş Remiz'de ve beş İşaret'te gösterilen parlak hakikat-i âliye, nur-u Kur'an ile görünür ve imanın kuvvetiyle sahib olunabilir. Yoksa o hakikat-i bâkiye yerine, gayet müdhiş bir zulümat geçer. Ehl-i dalalet için dünya, firaklar ve zevaller ile dolu ve ademler ile mâlâmâldir. Kâinat, onun için manevî bir Cehennem hükmüne geçer. Herşey onun için âni bir vücud ile, hadsiz bir adem ihata ediyor. Bütün mazi ve müstakbel, zulümat-ı ademle memlûdür; yalnız kısacık bir zaman-ı halde, bir hazîn nur-u vücud bulabilir. Fakat sırr-ı Kur'an ve nur-u iman ile, ezelden ebede kadar bir nur-u vücud görünür; ona alâkadar olur ve onunla saadet-i ebediyesini temin eder.
   Elhasıl: 
   Bir Şâir-i Mısrî'nin tarzında deriz:
   Derya olunca nefes   Parelenince kafes   Tâ kesilince bu ses
   Çağırırım: Yâ Hak! Yâ Mevcud! Yâ Hayy! Yâ Mabud!    Yâ Hakîm! Yâ Maksud! Yâ Rahîm! Yâ Vedud!..    Ve bağırarak derim:
لَٓا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ الْمُب۪ينُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ صَادِقُ الْوَعْدِ الْاَم۪ينُ

Scenes like this make me excited for what we can build off world.

Unfortunately most of your theory can not be proven but you state it as fact.... tell me who was alive millions of years ago before humans were alive also tell me who was alive more then 6 thousand years ago that you can also verify your statements... the problem is that you can't so therefore it's nothing but guessing. Why would you state as fact what you can't prove? Now let's talk about what is fact! It is fact that almost every culture has ancient drawings that have a large boat in it and a flood that is a fact... I wonder what that tells us and how we need to change the lenses of what we are looking through. It is also fact that archeologist are finding evidence constantly confirming what the bibical record says. It is fact that scientists also are confirming what the biblical record tells us. It is also fact what astronomers are also finding evidence of what the biblical record tells us.... thousands and thousands of pieces of evidence being dug up that correlate perfectly to the biblical record. But your records of where you got all this information was made up in the last 200 years. Darwin Hawkins Dawkins I wonder what I would trust.... Bill nye believes we came from bananas. All the so called evidence of half apes humans were collected over large areas and put together and made it look like that. I wonder where is the half apes running around.... like if we evolved then why is they only ape and only humans and not half breeds walking around... where is the proof of any of this so called science... there is none... it really appears that men wanted to deny the existence of God so they made a bunch of theories up so they don't have to submit to that God... the Bible is being proven dailey that it is not only accurate it's also reliable and is the most logical. Carbon dating is flawed and all the scientists know it. It is based off of opinion with no true observations of its truth.,0,0

"deepest cave is under water in russia, with maxium depth explored -32mi, maxium depth unknown. carls bad caves havnt been measured at full depths tho probably not as deep as these. however the caves at the bottom of the grand canyon already massively below sea level havnt been explored either. as you could fit 1000's of 100 story buildings in the grand canyon. where the things inside the caves at the canyon like the scorpions and the snakes is why its off limits to explore, so they say. what makes this place unique is its isolated biosphere within the cave at the lowest levels. as there is literally 100s of caves like this in that region due to the lime degradations and fissure pressing of the tectonic plates much like the colorado mountains. as 100s of gold mines in the mountains have been forced to shut down because of how these places sit next to the 132 california fault lines. as there are 1000s of unexplored fissure wells in those mountains. and the 2nd deepest cave on record is that asteroid creator that was responsible for the iceage. a pocket deep in the planets core of diamonds and sulferic ash. only accessible with deep core mining rigs atm... and only found because of oil searches. as this cave in the video, is the deepest human accessible known cave.",0,0

The underground river that flows through the cave adds to the mystery, while mist and small clouds create an otherworldly landscape.
Exploring Son Doong is not only an adventure but also a journey to witness the magical beauty of nature. It is a testament to the greatness of the Earth and urges people to protect these unique natural wonders for future generations.",0,0

"Jesus is the only WAY to God, the TRUTH and LIFE. Sins separate us from God because He's Holy. All sins will be forgiven & erased through faith in Jesus. God loves you and is waiting with His arms wide open FOR YOU! Jesus become a mediator between God and men. Repent and confess from your heart and through your mouth that you are a sinner in need of a Savior; that He had died for your sins, that He had risen from the dead and ask that He forgives you, that He comes into your life and become your Lord and Saviour.

Through the faith in Christ Jesus, the sick was healed; He healed the blind, the mute, the deaf, the demon-possessed, raised the dead, as well as performed many miracles; He walked on water, turned water into wine, calmed the storm with His command and was raised up from the dead.

"Truth: every place on earth that has life has an ecosystem, nothing special here.
Truth: the title picture is faked, the cave does not look like that.
Truth: trees use photosynthesis, and that needs light.  There can't be forests in caves where light cannot reach.  Let me repeat that sentiment... THERE ARE NO FORESTS IN CAVES.  Absolutely at the mouth of caves and in places where the floor above caved in... not in the cave itself.
Truth: it's a stretch of credibility (at best) to breaking to say that there are ""lakes"", ""rivers"", ""clouds"" etc.  This is BS.  In fact this entire channel is BS.  Gonna block this loser now.",0,0
