from vietnam and i still believe something like son doong exists in our like most of us growing up had no not something you hear about in school or from people around we knew about caves and nature but no one ever said a massive cave with clouds and a whole rainforest inside it just sounds too Then i watched this video and it hit did this place stay hidden for so millions of years just doing its a with clouds forming a river running through animals and plants you find anywhere like nature kept a secret from the world and only decided to share it and the fact that it was only fully explored in like not even that long Some of the stuff in the video just blows your like how do you even have enough space underground to fit a story the stalagmites looking like ancient stone the cave the phytokarst rocks that move toward the like stepping into a world that follow the usual you see this stuff and suddenly you realize how much of the planet we still As a vietnamese it makes me feel but also kinda we always talk about vietnam being son doong is something else not just something the whole world should respect and not just visit for and i really appreciate how only one is allowed to take people it keeps it keeps it So thanks for making this i honestly expecting to feel this way watching a cave but it made me pause and really sometimes you have to see your own country through someone eyes to realize how lucky you Sending love from vietnam,3,0

These people are so NOT prepared for jungle trekking You pull leaches off because they can leave their parts in your skin and create infection Use a cigarette lighter on their tail or salt to back them out Wear full pantyhose as an undergarment and wear high boots that you can put elastic bands around the pants to seal off on the boot tops Never wear shorts or short sleeved shirts in the jungle no matter how hot it is Certain vines like gotya vine have sharp hook like thorns that will cut your legs and arms A single scratch on your leg or arm can turn septic quickly Carry a bottle of Iodine based antiseptic and treat every little cut or rash quickly Take anti malaria tablets Put cotton wool or some cloth inside your ears when you sleep in the jungle so bugs crawl into your ears or better yet sleep in a mosquito net skinny dip in jungle pools and rivers as they have parasitic organisms that will enter your body and make you sick or even cause cysts and cancers Wearing the pantyhose stops that and hinders leaches Never drink the jungle stream water without using purification tablets or use a quality high microbial filter but collecting rain water directly with a tent fly is ok in an open area make camp or sleep in low lying areas as sudden monsoonal rain can flood you in seconds Been there done that and nearly drowned,0,0

How To Live In Harmony With Nature And Reduce Pollution Many Production Which We Do Not Need Actually For Human Beings Has To Be Stopped We manufacture so many products and it is creating So if we minimise our pollution would be We produce so many things which we do not like cold leather potato fruit ice Cold fruit ice Should be cooked at home If we stopped producing this things which are not required for so much pollution could be If we colour the clothes pollution So if we colour our the pollution resulting from colouring the clothes can be Let everything remain in natural We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form We can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat Rice and Wheat is produced in Then it is packed and transported to big then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail But if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set machines and working staffs are When a company is built many other things are also Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the So if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing tomato fruit the things required for the company and the plastic paper box pack and glass If done like so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the Also we could save our money like If you buy a packet of it would cost you more money than if you cook wheat and rice in Previously before industrial we have but our foods were rich with Now we have but technology is polluting our foods and our foods are not rich with and because of that also we have health If this is then many jobs would be For that many peoples should do farming and they should be given loans if they do not have enough money to start farming on their Surgeries and should be made free to the world till the world settles down with After that surgeries and should be stopped free to the Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do Is their any another that humans lose jobs and also pollution would Humans have to take this step certainly instead of going on polluting the making wildlife extinct and also mass extinctions of humans in Electricity Pollution We create electricity from many types of sources like but it creates If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs in the creation But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would As I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not needed for then the world would not require so much If less electricity then less pollution Could We Stop Drinking and Milk Whatever vitamins and nutrients we get from if we can get it from other eatable then we can stop drinking and As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to All of this can be For infants whose have died or who cannot breast feed their only for them and milk should be We use milk in tea and Instead of milk we must use coconut milk with How Much Should Be The Population Every place should have a single No everything ground If we do this and the whole lands of our planet earth would be occupied one day with then we would come to know how much our planet earth can have maximum Once the population is then we have to maintain that For example if our earth can have a population of billion then when the population reaches then everyone should have only one child till the population reaches billion As if we have only one child then the population When population is billion then everyone should have till the population reaches billion After that again we should have only one In this way population can be,0,0

Thank you for posting educational and interesting videos and taking these risks to deliver messages across the Truly a wonder some of these Just when we think we know all about the or that only places we explored on earth is the bottom of our is such a fabrication of the truth and what WANT us to think or believe and It is but also relieving to know that most people still do not fully understand our world because it keeps the mind and mystery And yet we are funded fully and then some to go into outer send ground breaking high tech satellites to take pictures of other galaxies topic in itself which is truly amazing and or send a Tesla to the new millennium is so far completely mind blowing and we are only scratching the we are shown bits and pieces of new tech or what we think is new but its been decades since development for many things And where I find Astrology and technology we should be more invested in spending tax dollars with our planet and invest in what we are capable of doing NOW or TOMORROW and not so much if there is water on mind boggling sometimes to know there is so much poverty and so much money goes into looking for space dust instead of feeding I try to understand more about the earths history and it has become so apparent how human beings and greed has effected everything and anything on yet most of the powerful and persons capable of change never truly does ANYTHING to either stop global warming or end kids Our Earth is and if our kids wont see or even their kids maybe the next And having the mindset of ill be who well guess possibly your family down the line will very much be People need to stop being so LETS Fix the slums Lets fund give equal opportunity to all human How is that such a hard THANK YOU RUHI for posting educational I would truly love to explore with They truly mean the world of a difference for,0,0

Understanding the Biblical Timeline The biblical particularly as outlined in the book of suggests that the Earth and the universe were created in six approximately years This interpretation is based on genealogies and chronologies found in which many Christians take For Genesis describes God creating the world in six with each interpreted by some as a literal The Argument Against Long Ages Literal Interpretation of The Hebrew word which translates to is often cited as evidence that the creation days were literal Proponents argue that this interpretation aligns with how the term is used elsewhere in the Genealogical Many Christians point to genealogies listed in the Bible from Adam to as a way to calculate the age of humanity and By adding up these they arrive at an approximate age of around Historical Events such as the Great Flood are viewed as significant markers in history that would have reset or altered geological timelines if taken Critique of Radiometric Dating Assumptions of Constant Decay Critics argue that radiometric dating relies on assumptions about decay rates being constant over millions of They suggest that these rates may not have been consistent throughout Questioning Historical Some assert that because scientists were not present during they cannot accurately determine its age through scientific methods like radiometric Alternative Explanations for Geological Certain geological features can be explained through catastrophic events a global rather than slow processes over billions of A Biblical Framework From this those who adhere to a young Earth creationist view argue that scientific claims about millions and billions of years are based on flawed assumptions and interpretations that contradict a straightforward reading of They maintain that Word provides an accurate account of creation and human history without needing to reconcile it with secular scientific In proponents of a young Earth perspective would The belief in millions and billions of years contradicts biblical teachings regarding Scripture supports a timeline where God created the Earth approximately years ago over six literal,0,0

Unfortunately most of your theory can not be proven but you state it as tell me who was alive millions of years ago before humans were alive also tell me who was alive more then thousand years ago that you can also verify your the problem is that you so therefore nothing but Why would you state as fact what you Now talk about what is It is fact that almost every culture has ancient drawings that have a large boat in it and a flood that is a I wonder what that tells us and how we need to change the lenses of what we are looking It is also fact that archeologist are finding evidence constantly confirming what the bibical record It is fact that scientists also are confirming what the biblical record tells It is also fact what astronomers are also finding evidence of what the biblical record tells thousands and thousands of pieces of evidence being dug up that correlate perfectly to the biblical But your records of where you got all this information was made up in the last Darwin Hawkins Dawkins I wonder what I would Bill nye believes we came from All the so called evidence of half apes humans were collected over large areas and put together and made it look like I wonder where is the half apes running like if we evolved then why is they only ape and only humans and not half breeds walking where is the proof of any of this so called there is it really appears that men wanted to deny the existence of God so they made a bunch of theories up so they have to submit to that the Bible is being proven dailey that it is not only accurate also reliable and is the most Carbon dating is flawed and all the scientists know It is based off of opinion with no true observations of its,0,0
